Mazda is also going to use the Chicago show to introduce its Heritage Collection, which encompasses three clothing lines said to be inspired by Mazda’s past, present, and future. If “Past” means we’ll be leaving Chicago wearing clothing emblazoned with graphic images of vintage rotary engine schematics and Mazda R360 sedans culled from the corporate archives, we can’t wait. We’ll leave the “Present” and “Future” lines for those more afflicted with the Miata disorder.
