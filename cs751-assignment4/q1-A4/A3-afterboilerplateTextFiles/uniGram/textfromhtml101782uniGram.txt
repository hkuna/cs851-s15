I
loved
this
book!
I
got
lost
in
it!
Tina
created
the
people
in
the
book
that
have
a
lot
of
substance
to
them.
I
love
the
way
she
wrote
about
the
issues
Karen
faced
with
ex
husband
&
how
she
finally
let
it
go.
I
loved
how
Karen
helped
Daniel
get
over
losing
his
wife.
I
loved
the
way
were
together
as
friends
first
then
lovers.
I
would
recommend
this
book
if
want
an
excellent
read!
