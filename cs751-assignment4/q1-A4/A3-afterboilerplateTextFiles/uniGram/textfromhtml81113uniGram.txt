â€œHow
are
you
feeling
now
Toby?
Are
things
beginning
to
make
a
little
more
sense?â€?
â€œIâ€™m
not
sure
Mr
Wibbetts.
Will
we
take
long
to
get
to
my
Auntâ€™s
house
do
you
think?â€?
â€œAre
you
worried
about
something
Toby?â€?
Wibbetts
asked,
doing
his
best
to
turn
to
look
at
the
boy
seated
directly
behind
him.
â€œTheyâ€™re
coming,â€?
was
the
boyâ€™s
only
answer,
sending
a
shiver
down
the
old
manâ€™s
spine.
