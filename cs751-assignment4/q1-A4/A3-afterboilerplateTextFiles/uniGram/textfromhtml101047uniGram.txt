Luckily
Internet
heroes
BooYa
Pictures
have
taken
it
upon
themselves
to
improve
the
original
Fifty
Shades
movie
trailer
by
replacing
Dornan
with
the
Boardwalk
Empire
star.
In
the
vastly
superior
clip,
perky
college
grad
Anastasia
Steele
(Dakota
Johnson)
comes
to
interview
the
CEO
of
Grey
Enterprises
and
canâ€™t
help
but
fall
in
lust
with
the
man
behind
the
desk,
who
now
played
by
Buscemi.
Can
you
blame
her?
business
man
with
singular
tastes
is,
of
course,
Steve
Buscemi.
