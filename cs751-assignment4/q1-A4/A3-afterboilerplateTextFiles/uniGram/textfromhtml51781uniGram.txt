Judge
Hellerstein
today
issued
an
order
giving
the
government
until
March
17th
to
explain
to
him
â€œthe
factual
basisâ€?
for
deciding
whether
the
photos
can
be
released,
or
else
lose
its
case.
â€œAt
minimum,â€?
he
wrote,
the
government
â€œmust
describe
the
categories
of
objectionable
content
contained
in
the
photographs,
identify
how
many
photographs
fit
into
each
category,
and
specify
the
type
of
harm
that
would
result
from
disclosing
such
content.â€?
That
rationale
may
be
filed
under
seal,
he
said.
