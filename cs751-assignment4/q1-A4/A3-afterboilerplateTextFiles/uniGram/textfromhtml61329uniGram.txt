But
that
being
said,
I
think
the
writers
and
producers
of
The
Walking
Dead…
Scott
Gimple
is
an
incredibly
talented
guy,
and
I
think
that’s
the
only
way
he
would
do
it.
If
they
wanted
to
do
it
and
it
worked
out
I
think
it
would
be
cool.
But
I
am
by
no
means
waiting
by
the
phone
for
that
one.
[Laughs.]
I’m
really
happy
doing
what
I’m
doing.
