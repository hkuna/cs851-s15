The
platform
of
the
nationalists
and
anti-reform
parties
of
left
and
right
offer
what
they
always
offer:
anger
but
not
answers.
They
peddle
ghastly
and
reactionary
myths
about
immigrants;
they
pretend
that
complex
problems
have
easy
pain-free
solutions;
and
there
is
a
worrying
authoritarianism
(evident
in
their
admiration
for
the
Vladimir
Putin
brand
of
leadership)
which
lurks
only
a
little
beneath
the
surface.
But
if
the
centre
does
not
lead,
the
extremes
will
be
followed.
The
Greek
crisis
is
an
opportunity.
It
has
to
be
seized.
