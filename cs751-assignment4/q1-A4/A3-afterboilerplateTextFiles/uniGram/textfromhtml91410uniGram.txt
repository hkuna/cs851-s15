Following
the
Snowden’s
disclosures
about
NSA,
the
furor
erupted
over
U.S.
Government
surveillance
programs,
but
the
underlying
issue
was
actually
corporate
and
state
power
over
the
extraterritorial
Internet.
The
long-standing
international
conflict
over
the
Internet’s
skewed
structure
in
turn
became
freighted
with
new
contingency.
In
an
insurrectionary
world,
the
question
of
how
the
Internet
might
be
restructured
—and
with
what
ramifications
for
business—
was
not
only
increasingly
palpable
but
also
vital.
