An

said
the
organization
is
gathering
senior
leaders
from
companies
that
buy
and
sell
media
to
discuss
mobile
measurement.
"Later
in
the
year,
we
will
start
a
working
group
to
begin
updating
IAB's
existing
mobile
ad-measurement
guidelines
with
more
explicit
viewability
requirements
and
writing
an
industry
standard
with
our
partners
from
across
the
ecosystem,"
she
added.
