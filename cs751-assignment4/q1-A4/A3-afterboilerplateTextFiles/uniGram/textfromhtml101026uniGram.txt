After
an
update
of
material
ui
ok
google
hotword
detection
is
problematic.
Have
to
shout
for
15
times
to
detect
a
result.
Then
what's
the
use
of
it.
In
this
much
time
it
is
better
to
do
it
manually.
Instead
of
detecting
English
accents
if
it
detects
frequency
and
amplitude
of
sound
then
it
would
be
better.ï»¿
