This
has
been
a
story
at
Gap
for
a
while
now.
Banana
Republic,
and
especially
Old
Navy,
thrive
as
the
flagship
brand
continues
to
sag.
This
comes
just
a
few
weeks
after
Danish
branding
guru
Rebekka
Bay
departed
from
the
Gap
brand—​she
wasn’t
able
to
perform
the
magic
there
many
expected
her
to,
at
least
not
during
the
time
she
was
given.
