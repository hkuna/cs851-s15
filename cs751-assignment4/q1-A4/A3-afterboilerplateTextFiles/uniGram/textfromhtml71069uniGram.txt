Journalist
Daniel
Simone
made
very
bold
claims
this
past
week
while
speaking
with
The
Post.
According
to
Simone,
Charles
Mansonâ€˜s
very
young
fiancÃ©e
only
got
engaged
to
the
convicted
murderer
so
that
she
could
put
his
body
on
â€œpublic
displayâ€?
after
he
died.
At
the
time,
80-year-old
Manson
figured
out
heâ€™d
been
deceived
and
never
got
married.

the
very
interesting
story
