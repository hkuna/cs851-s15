â€œThe
failings
of
this
era
very
much
reflect
what
young
people
are
now
saying
about
police
shootings,â€?
Stevenson
said.
â€œIt
is
about
embracing
this
idea
that
â€˜black
lives
matterâ€™,â€?
he
added.
â€œI
also
think
that
the
lynching
era
created
a
narrative
of
racial
difference,
a
presumption
of
guilt,
a
presumption
of
dangerousness
that
got
assigned
to
African
Americans
in
particular
â€“
and
thatâ€™s
the
same
presumption
of
guilt
that
burdens
young
kids
living
in
urban
areas
who
are
sometimes
menaced,
threatened,
or
shot
and
killed
by
law
enforcement
officers.â€?
