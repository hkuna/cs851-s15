‘The
Metal
East’,
the
album's
opener,
"sets
the
tone"
for
the
rest
of
the
record,
according
to
Chippendale,
thundering
through
four
minutes
of
sinister
low-end
rumbles,
skittish
percussion
and
animal
screams.
Dark
and
haunting?
Yes.
But
a
tonne
of
fun
too.
The
pair's
live
shows
are
a
thing
of
legend,
typically
setting
up
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
crowd,
like
something
out
of
a
pandemonious
guerrilla
rave.
I've
still
got
some
bruises
from
the
last
Lightning
Bolt
show
I
went
to,
and
that
was
in
2008.
A
breathless
rollercoaster
of
lysergic
riffs,
'The
Metal
East'
will
fit
in
right
at
home
live
amidst
fan-favourites
like
'Dracula
Mountain'
and
'Assassins'.
Give
it
a
listen
below
and
keep
an
eye
out
for
'Fantasy
Empire',
out
on
March
23.
alled
‘Fantasy
Empire’,
but
like
everything
Lightning
Bolt
touch,
its
violent
noises
are
born
of
our
own
twisted
reality.
