I
heartily
endorse
subguns
for
a
variety
of
different
types
of
operations.
I
think
their
role
needs
to
be
re-examined
by
American
law
enforcement.
Here
are
a
few
reasons
why:
pistol-round
lethality
has
improved
dramatically
over
the
last
10
years,
subguns
are
far
more
controllable
than
carbines,
hearing
injuries
to
officers
are
far
less
with
pistol
rounds,
and
officers
tend
to
become
proficient
in
their
use
at
a
far
quicker
rate
than
when
using
carbines
in
rifle
calibers.
The
KRISS
Vector
SDP
.45
ACP
pistol
is
not
technically
a
subgun
because
it
does
not
have
a
stock.
It
has
the
advantage
of
being
more
concealable,
yet
offers
fast,
accurate
rounds
on
target
in
an
instant.
The
unique
characteristics
of
the
KRISS
SDP
make
it
far
more
controllable
under
rapid
fire
than
anything
else
I
have
ever
tested.
