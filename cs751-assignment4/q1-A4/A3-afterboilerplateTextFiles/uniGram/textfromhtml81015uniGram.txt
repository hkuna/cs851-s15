Jo,
I
am
deeply
moved
beyond
words
today
as
I
read
your
writing
and
saw
the
pictures.
I
remember
the
day
we
shared
in
the
gazebo…when
I
saw
your
face
change
and
the
tears
flow…I
cried
with
you
as
I
remember
the
flood
gates
flowing
from
my
eyes
in
the
dark
experience
of
my
own
life.
God
has
walked
with
you
all
the
way
and
touched
your
heart,
soul
and
mind
when
he
knew
you
were
ready
…our
God
is
gentle
and
feels
our
pain.
Your
sharing
these
intimate
details
will
bring
healing
to
many
but
most
of
all
to
you.
Bless
you.
Gay
Lynne
