Undermining
US
Foreign
Policy
is
an
act
of
treason
by
those
who
perpetrated
this
Netanyahu
speech
before
Congress
,
getting
a
Foreign
Head
of
State
to
try
to
influence
policy
is
truly
treason
.
This
is
a
long
way
from
just
wanting
your
own
way
for
the
Republican
Party
.
This
would
not
happen
to
a
White
President
(lots
of
racism
permeates
the
Rep.
Party
now
)
