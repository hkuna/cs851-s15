It's
safe
to
say
that
New
Jersey,
and
specifically
Newark,
has
not
been
shown
in
the
best
light
in
the
public
eye.
With
extremely
high
crime,
murder
and
unemployment
rates,
NADUS
seems
to
bring
light
and
a
positive
message
from
within
a
city
fighting
to
rise
above
this
stigma.
22-year-old
Nadus
Bright,
Jr
is
a
true
cultural
product
of
his
city.
He's
used
the
negative
surroundings
of
his
upbringing
to
shed
a
positivity
light
from
his
neighborhood
to
global
appeal.
The
THREAD
co-founder,
Jersey
Club
and
future
bass
pioneer,
was
co-signed
as
a
Brick
Bandits
member
at
the
young
age
of
15.
With
support
from
G's
like
Diplo,
Dirty
South
Joe,
Sliink,
Tim
Dolla,
it's
time
for
NADUS'
story
of
life,
music,
and
triumph
to
shine
