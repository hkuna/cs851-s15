Created
this
to
help
folks
expose
the
hypocrisy
and
discrimination
that
the
GOP,
Tea
Party,
and
all
their
associated
crazies
are
trying
to
codify
into
American
law:
h/t
jamess
for
the
updated
Cruz
&
...

and
more
taxes!
More
taxes,
because
of
the
HUGE
tax
cuts,
on
top
of
the
other,
already
in
place
cuts
for
the
very
rich,
who
never
pay
any
taxes
at
all!or
a
massive
tax
hike
on
the
backs
of
more
than
7
million
middle
class
Americans.
You
know...the
voting
kind.
And
those
same
VOTERS
are
being
denied
their
RIGHT
TO
VOTE
by
all
the
new
voter
suppression
laws
passed
by
Republicon-controlled
States!
Got
to
suppress
those
Voters,
who
would
unseat
the
clowns!
Reagan
raised
huge
taxes,
while
telling
everybody
a
lie,
and
raised
them
more!
Well!
Weeeelllll!
That
Reagan
was
a
LIAR!
Raised
Taxes
after
all!
But!
The
stupids
blamed
the
Democrats
because
they
thought
Reagan
was
an
Academy
Award
winning
star!
Wasn't
some
movie
were
he
played
a
chimp
or
a
chomp?
Won
how
many
Oscars?
None!
Oh!
Well!
The
taxes
were
raised
any
way!
