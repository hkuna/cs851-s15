The
adidas
Originals
Top
Ten
â€œFloralâ€?
will
be
arriving
at
select
brand
providers
on
February
12.
ng
up
from
the
Three
Stripes,
especially
with
NBA
All-Star
weekend
being
just
days
away.
One
such
drop
is
the
Top
Ten
â€œFloralâ€?
from
adidasâ€™
Originals
division.
Showcasing
a
textured
snakeskin
upper,
the
high-tops
have
then
been
draped
in
floral.
No
doubt
the
unique
aspect
about
these
Top
Tens
is
the
all-over
print
that
extends
from
upper
to
tongue
to
sole.
Black
laces
accompany
the
colorful
kicks
that
then
welcome
gold
branding
throughout.
