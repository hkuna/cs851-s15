â€œThings
like
the
Premier
League,
the
BBC
and
the
Queen
are
things
that
people
feel
are
good
about
the
UK.
Ultimately,
weâ€™re
a
success
story.
As
are
the
people
who
have
bought
our
broadcast
rights.â€?
l
their
stadiums.
â€œThe
clubs
have
to
keep
the
stadia
full
and
go
on
attracting
a
new
audience
and
a
new
fanbase
all
the
time.
The
clubs
have
to
do
something
to
make
sure
the
stadia
are
full.
They
will
be
encouraged
by
us,â€?
he
said.
â€œTo
my
core,
I
believe
this
is
a
success
story,
itâ€™s
a
great
UK
export.
It
generates
lots
of
positive
attitudes
about
the
UK.â€?
