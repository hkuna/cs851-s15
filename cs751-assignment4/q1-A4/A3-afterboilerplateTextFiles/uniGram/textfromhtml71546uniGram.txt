Go
get
a
job
and
what?
Pay
bills.
Right.
If
you
haven't
noticed
most
26
year
old
+
are
on
the
path
to
having
ZERO
drive,
or
care
for
a
stable
career.
Corrupt?
More
like
way
it
is.
That's
why
you
bite
the
bullet
and
grow
some
nuts
if
you
really
want
to
do
what
you
love.
Or
you
can
keep
living,
and
simply
that.
Everything
is
corrupt.
But
this
is
advice,
not
the
constitution.
There
is
a
lot
of
truth
in
this.
