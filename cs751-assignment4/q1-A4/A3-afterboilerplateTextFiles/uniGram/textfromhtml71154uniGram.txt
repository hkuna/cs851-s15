Relive
the
excitement
of
the
2014
World
Championship
with
a
special
behind-the-scenes
look
at
Imagine
Dragons
at
Worlds!
From
their
first
steps
onto
the
field
at
Sangam
Stadium
to
the
pyro
celebrating
Samsung
White,
we
were
with
the
guys
to
document
this
historic
partnership.
Don’t
miss
this
exclusive
look
at
the
band’s
experiences
getting
set
for
the
big
day,
playing
in
front
of
the
big
crowd,
and
throwing
down
with
Sjokz
and
others
Rioters
on
the
Rift
in
a
backstage
PC
Bang.
