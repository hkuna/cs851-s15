This
is
the
Revelation
of
Jesus
Christ,
which
God
gave
him
to
show
to
his
servants
the
things
which
must
happen
soon,
which
he
sent
and
made
known
by
his
angel
to
his
servant,
John,
who
testified
to
Godâ€™s
word,
and
of
the
testimony
of
Jesus
Christ,
about
everything
that
he
saw.
Blessed
is
he
who
reads
and
those
who
hear
the
words
of
the
prophecy,
and
keep
the
things
that
are
written
in
it,
for
the
time
is
at
hand.
