My
children
received
a
Smithsonian
Rock
and
Gem
Dig
kit
for
Christmas.
We
go
hiking
and
camping
frequently
and
they
love
looking
for
rocks
during
our
outdoor
family
adventures.
I
knew
this
gift
was
going
to
be
a
hit
with
Mason
and
Sophie.
The
kit
includes:
1
block
containing
11
real
gemstones,
minerals,
or
rocks
1
dowel
1
[â€¦]
