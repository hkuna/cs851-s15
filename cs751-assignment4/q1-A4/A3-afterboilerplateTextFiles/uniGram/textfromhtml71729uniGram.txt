And
the
government’s
response?
At
a
business
leaders’
meeting
recently
David
Cameron
pathetically
asked
bosses
if
they
would
give
their
staff
a
pay-rise,
and
so
spread
their
ever-increasing
wealth
around*.
I
thought
in
a
Free
Market
Economic
system
wealth
was
supposed
to
naturally
‘trickle
down’
anyway?
Clearly
not,
and
if
Cameron
thinks
his
desperate
pleas
will
make
any
difference
to
their
behaviour,
he
clearly
has
little
understanding
of
the
business
community
he
claims
to
represent.
siness
practices.
What
a
rotten
system
we
live
in,
that
allows
such
things
to
go
on
while
poor
people
are
forced
to
undergo
ever-increasing
Austerity.
