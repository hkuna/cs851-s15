Technological
innovation
may
bring
its
greatest
benefits
in
projects
of
social
utility.
In
Barcelona
and
in
La
Garrotxa,
city
managers
and
IT
project
managers
have
created
a
new
working
dynamic
by
setting
priorities
that
align
communities
as
they
strive
to
improve
resilience
for
neighborhoods
and
for
an
entire
region.
Spain
is
developing
an
ecosystem
comprised
of
technology
enterprises,
universities,
private
industry,
municipalities,
regional
government
stakeholders
working
together
to
benefit
cities
where
we
live
and
work.
