I
am
so
glad
I
made
the
decision
to
come
this
year
there
are
so
many
geneabloggers
here
that
we
really
should
get
the
message
out
there
to
the
community
that
genealogy
is
all
about
collaboration.
You
never
know
what
your
connection
may
be
with
the
person
next
to
you.
Serendipitous
moments
are
such
a
joy.
We
are
all
related!!
