Solving
mysteries,
both
criminal
and
medical,
requires
good
data
–
including
data
that
is
often
overlooked
or
has
not
previously
been
available.
It’s
fun
to
imagine
what
a
modern
Sherlock
Holmes
could
do
with
the
data
provided
by
wearable
devices.
Fortunately,
we
don’t
have
to
do
too
much
imagining
when
it
comes
to
the
many
formerly
missing
pieces
of
health
information
that
are
now
available
to
physicians
to
assist
in
a
more
holistic
patient
assessment.
The
more
information
doctors
have,
the
better
able
they
are
to
reasonably
deduce
the
best
plan
for
individual
patient
health.
