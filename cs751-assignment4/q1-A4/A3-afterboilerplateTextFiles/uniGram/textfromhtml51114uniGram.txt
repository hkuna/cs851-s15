I
cooked
today.
I
cooked
‘bread
rolls’.
More
like
OVERSIZED
DOUGH
BALLS
THAT
ARE
BOWING
DOWN
TO
PIZZA
EXPRESS!
The
oversized
dough
balls
are
amazing
though.
I
ate
my
weight
in
bread
today.
I’m
a
monster.
I
just
really
like
bread.
And
baking.
And
food.
My
personal
mantra:
Nutella
is
love.
Nutella
is
life.Can
you
relate?I
guessed
so.
Unless
you’re
allergic
to
nuts.
:-(
If
there
is
a
God,
why
would
he
make
people
get
an
anaphylactic
shock
just
from
having
a
spoonful
of
Nutella?
It’s
just
cruel
you
know?
It’s
like
God
wanted
us
to
invent
nutella,
and
then
he
jumps
in
at
the
last
minute
to
tell
us
people
are
gonna
be
allergic.
Disclaimer:
I
don’t
actually
believe
in
God,
I’m
speaking
hypothetically
here.
PLZ
NO
HATERSSSSS
