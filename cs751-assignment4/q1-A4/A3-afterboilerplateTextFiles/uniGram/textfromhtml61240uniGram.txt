Libertarianism
rests
on
the
whimsical
notion
that
all
people
are
isolated,
entirely
free
agents
with
no
claims
on
others
except
those
that
they
can
negotiate
through
consensual
contracts.
The
very
existence
of
children
flatly
disproves
this;
any
moral
intuition
indicates
that
children
come
into
the
world
with
claims
on
their
parents
at
the
very
least,
and
their
entire
societies
considered
broadly.
To
avoid
a
hellish
death
spiral
of
infectious
disease
and
neglect,
we
would
all
do
well
to
reject
Paul
and
his
cohort
on
the
subject
of
child
rearing.
port
of
this
duty
inadequate,
we
can
only
conclude
that
no
such
duty
exists
â€¦
one
has
to
regard
the
notion
of
a
legal
duty
of
parents
to
support
their
children
as
without
merit.â€?
Evers
allows
that
parents
might
be
morally
obligated
to
do
something
for
their
children,
but
also
that
morals
should
not
be
legally
enforced.
Therefore,
vaccination,
labor,
and
finally
whether
or
not
to
give
oneâ€™s
children
the
necessities
of
life
ultimately
comes
down,
for
these
classic
libertarian
thinkers,
to
the
free
will
of
the
parents.
