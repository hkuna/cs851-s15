This
rare
example
of
a
gravitational
lens
is
known
as
an
‘Einstein
Ring’
—
after
Albert
Einstein’s
theory
of
general
relativity
that
predicts
the
existence
of
gravitational
lenses
in
deep
space
—
where
the
galactic
cluster
in
the
foreground
and
the
hidden
(lensed)
galaxy
behind
are
in
almost
perfect
alignment
from
our
perspective.
