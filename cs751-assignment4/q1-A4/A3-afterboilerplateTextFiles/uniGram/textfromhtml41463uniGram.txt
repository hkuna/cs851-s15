I
knew
this
day
would
finally
come,
and
I'm
so
happy
it
did.
Hopefully
now
Marvel
will
treat
this
iconic
character
right
and
not
have
him
bastardized
like
he
was
in
the
last
two
installments.
Truly
"amazing"
news!
e
have
wanted
Dylan
O'Brian
but
he
just
started
the
maze
runner
series
so
he'll
be
busy
too).
On
the
plus
side
The
Hunger
Games
series
is
already
done
and
coming
to
an
end
this
November.
So
he's
free
to
join
in
and
be
the
new
Spider-Man
for
the
MCU.
