Cool
addition,
but...
WHERE
THE
********
IS
FINLANDS
DEFENCE
FORCES!?!?
How
they
could
have
left
Finland
out
from
this?!
Specially
when
they
could
have
reused
some
of
the
units
from
other
countrys
like
Leopard
2's

them
all
beat.
you
just
have
to
learn
the
tactics
and
how
to
manage
multiple
types
of
units
with
both
offensive
and
passive
strategies.
