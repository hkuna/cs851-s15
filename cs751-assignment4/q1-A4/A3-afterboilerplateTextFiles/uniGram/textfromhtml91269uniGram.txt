Flowers,
a
walk,
watching
"Love
Actually",
"Notting
Hill",
"An
Affair
to
Remember",
"Casablanca",
"3-Iron"
or
"My
Sassy
Girl"
(the
latter
two
being
super-romantic,
subtitled
Korean
masterpieces)
will
do
the
trick.
Text
your
sweetie
first
thing
in
the
morning
that
you're
thinking
of
her/him.
You
don't
have
to
spend
a
lot
of
money.
There
are
free
concerts,
hikes,
picnics,
and
even
properly
presented
"rainchecks"
to
see
each
other
on
the
weekend.
