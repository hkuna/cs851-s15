Among
the
afflictions
and
indignities
borne
by
the
homeless,
the
surreal
news
of
a
Medicaid
scheme
that
preyed
on
them
-
perpetrators
made
millions
by
recruiting
the
poor
for
bogus
medical
tests
in
exchange
for
free
shoes
-
is
uncommonly
vile.
Most
days,
the
homeless
are
just
shunned,
scorned,
ignored
and
assailed,
as
a
new
campaign
by
an
advocacy
group
makes
grievously
clear.
Watch
homeless
people
read
vicious
tweets
about
themselves.
Then
weep
for
the
species.
