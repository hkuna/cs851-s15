This
is
marketing
at
its
best!
Some
clubs
are
turning
to
â€œfoot
golfâ€?,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
golf
and
this
club
is
introducing
pugilism.
â€˜Footâ€™
golf
got
a
little
publicity
but
pugilism
has
made
the
press
right
across
America
and
all
over
the
world.
Itâ€™s
novel,
itâ€™s
bold
and
itâ€™s
effective!
Anyone
in
the
area
of
this
club
who
has
a
fondness
for
dress
standards
that
are
disappearing
elsewhere
will
flock
along
to
join.
They
know
that
when
there
is
a
problem
patrolman
Joseph
Kozowyk
will
soon
be
on
the
scene.
â€œAny
publicity
is
good
publicity
as
long
as
they
spell
your
name
rightâ€?
