For
now,
though,
the
Boston
Dynamics
roboticists
far
away
on
the
east
coast
of
the
United
States
appear
at
liberty
to
carry
on
their
research
without
the
pressure
of
shipping
a
consumer
product.
Watch
out,
though
-
Spot
is
getting
smarter
and
may
one
day
decide
he's
had
enough
of
getting
kicked
around.
