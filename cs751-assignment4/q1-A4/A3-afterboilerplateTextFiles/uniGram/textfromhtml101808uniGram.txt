Dianne's
gathering
of
every
Bible
reference
to
the
birth
of
Jesus
is
phenomenal.
"Prophecies
Fulfilled"
is
a
wonderful
series,
clarifying
the
details
of
God's
plan
for
mankind
from
Genesis
through
Revelation.
Well
done
Diane!
that
even
those
who
have
not
read
the
Bible
can
understand.
Each
chapter
has
questions
regarding
the
text
and
about
applying
what
has
been
learned
to
our
lives.
The
understanding
of
prophecies
help
us
to
grasp
the
idea
that
our
God
is
a
God
or
order
and
a
God
who,
as
His
Word
says,
cannot
lie.
Dianne
E.
Butts
does
a
great
job
in
bringing
this
forward.
Looking
forward
to
reading
more
from
this
author.
