Words
really
matter.
Blavatsky
said
'the
universe
is
never
again
the
same
for
every
word
spoken!'.
Reading
and
writing
poems
and
poetry
helps
me
concentrate
on
words,
thoughts,
feelings.
My
first
son,
Andrew,
has
Down's
Syndrome
and
he
allows
me
to
see
the
world
differently
and
that's
a
great
source
of
inspiration
-
as
are
my
sons
Angus,
Adam
and
wife
Amelie...........words,
poems,
feelings
...........Love
-
of
course!!!
