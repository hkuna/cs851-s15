Basically,
the
trick
is
to
frame
your
disparate
view
in
the
context
of
your
team
or
companyâ€™s
larger
goals,
while
also
conveying
respect
for
your
higher-up
through
the
language
you
use
and
the
attitude
with
which
you
use
it.
Disagreement
can
even
be
productive
in
the
workplace,
if
and
when
it
is
communicated
properly.
f
respect
is
secure,
you
can
venture
into
expressing
your
views
openly
and
honestly.
