It
should
be
noted
that
recently,
U.S.
senators
are
more
and
more
inclined
to
believe
that
Ukraine
must
be
provided
with
lethal
weapons.
According
to
the
Senate
member
John
McCain,
if
Moscow
did
not
stop,
it
would
challenge
the
security
of
NATO.
That
is
why
the
United
States
and
NATO
allies
must
provide
Ukraine
with
defense
lethal
weapons.
