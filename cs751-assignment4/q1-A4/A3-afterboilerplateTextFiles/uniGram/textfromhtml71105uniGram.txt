The
feature
is
rolling
out
in
the
U.S.
first
with
plans
to
add
information
for
more
conditions
and
more
countries
in
the
future.
The
new
results,
which
have
been
fact-checked
by
Google’s
own
medical
team
as
well
as
doctors
at
the
Mayo
Clinic,
will
show
up
at
the
top
of
search
results
thanks
to
the
Knowledge
Graph.
That
means
they’ll
just
be
extra,
encyclopedic
information
and
still
leave
all
of
the
other,
more
factually
ambiguous
information
for
you
to
obsess
over
sift
through
for
yourself.
