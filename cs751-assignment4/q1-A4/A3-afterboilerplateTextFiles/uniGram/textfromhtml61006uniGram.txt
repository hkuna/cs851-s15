One
of
the
most
expensive
paintings,
Femme
aux
Bras
Crois�s,
was
auctioned
in
the
year
2000.
Just
after
its
creation
the
painting
was
bought
by
Gertrude
Stein
from
Picasso.
Later
on,
the
painting
was
taken
over
by
McCormick
family
who
organized
an
auction
at
Christie's
Rockefeller
in
New
York
City
and
sold
Femme
aux
Bras
Crois�s
for
$55,000,000
on
November
8,
2000.
The
price
of
the
painting
made
it
as
one
of
the
most
expensive
paintings
ever
sold
in
an
auction
by
then.
a
dominating
colour
on
canvas
with
little
emphasis
on
any
other,
Picasso
is
able
to
create
many
emotions
simply
by
the
tone
of
his
image.
This
coupled
with
the
exression
of
the
woman
and
her
body
language,
all
connote
a
sense
of
mystery
and
intrigue.
