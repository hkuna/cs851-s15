About
a
half-billion
dollars
worth
of
it
vanished
from
an
online
exchange
in
Tokyo.
A
prosecutor
in
Manhattan
arrested
the
24-year-old
vice
chairman
of
its
most
prominent
trading
body
on
drug-related
charges
of
money
laundering.
Its
founderâ€™s
identity
remains
a
mystery,
and
last
year,
it
shed
two-thirds
of
its
value,
losing
an
additional
44%
in
just
the
first
two
weeks
of
January.
In
his
year-end
letter
to
investors,
Warren
Buffettâ€™s
advice
about
it
was
emphatic:
â€œStay
away.â€?
