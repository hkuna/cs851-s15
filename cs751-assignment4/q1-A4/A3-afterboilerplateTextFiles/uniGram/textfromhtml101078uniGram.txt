â€œThe
plan
saddles
small,
independent
businesses
and
entrepreneurs
with
heavy-handed
regulations
that
will
push
them
out
of
the
market,â€?
said
Pai.
â€œAs
a
result,
Americans
will
have
fewer
broadband
choices.
This
is
no
accident.
Title
II
was
designed
to
regulate
a
monopoly.
If
we
impose
that
model
on
a
vibrant
broadband
marketplace,
a
highly
regulated
monopoly
is
what
weâ€™ll
get.â€?
