Watch
it
cute
but
does
not
work,
way
too
slow
and
the
one
in
black
I
got
does
not
work
at
all
it
gets
stuck
at
the
#
9.
If
you
want
as
bling
then
get
because
it
is
cute.
Just
hope
no
one
asks
you
what
time
it
is.
ng
fluff
photo.
It
would
take
several
minutes
if
not
an
hour
to
make
the
watch
look
like
the
photo.
The
design
is
unlike
any
other
wrap
bracelet
style
I've
ever
seen;
that
is
not
intended
to
be
a
compliment.
Second,
the
materials
are
of
the
cheapest
possibly
quality.
I
didn't
realize
that
because
the
reviews
didn't
really
spell
that
out;
they
were
mostly
positive.
Third,
the
watch
DOES
come
with
a
battery
-
there
is
a
small
white
gizmo
propping
up
the
adjustment
knob.
It
is
too
small
to
see
in
my
photos.
Yay
for
the
battery....but,
you
know,
good
old
fashioned
instructions
explaining
this
would
have
been
nice.
As
you
can
see,
other
reviewers
said
the
watch
didn't
work
or
didn't
come
with
a
battery,
so
I'm
not
the
only
one
who
would
appreciate
a
heads
up.
Fourth,
it
took
a
whole
32
days
from
the
day
I
ordered
it
to
receive
this
globetrotting
jewelry.
Fifth,
the
price
has
dropped
$3
since
I
placed
my
order
32
days
ago.
Someone
must
have
decided
to
be
more
honest
in
product
pricing.
The
only
positive
I
can
name
is
that
there
are
3
size
points
so
it
can
be
worn
loose
or
tight
as
one
desires.
I
love
my
other
wrap
bracelet
(purchased
elsewhere)
but
this
one
I
can't
stand.
