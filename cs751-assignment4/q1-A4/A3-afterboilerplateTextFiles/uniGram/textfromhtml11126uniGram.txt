Such
a
radical
intervention
is
necessary,
the
council
insists,
because
little
progress
has
been
made
so
far
in
addressing
social
deprivation
and
poor
housing
conditions.
Campbell,
who
arrived
herself
with
her
belongings
in
bin
bags,
like
some
of
the
newcomers
to
Blackpool
today,
is
convinced.
â€œI
lived
in
some
pretty
awful
houses,â€?
she
says.
â€œNow
I
get
to
make
decisions
to
help
people.â€?
