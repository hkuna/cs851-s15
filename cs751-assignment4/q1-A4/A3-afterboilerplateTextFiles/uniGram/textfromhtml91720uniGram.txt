"As
this
woman
aptly
pointed
out,
there
are
some
colleagues
in
the
Congress
who
really
have
a
mind
for
endless
war,"
he
said.
"I
do
not
want
to
see
an
endless
war
in
the
Middle
East."
He
talked
about
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
Iraq
and
Afghanistan
veterans
who'd
come
home
and
entered
the
Veterans
Affairs
health
care
system,
and
his
work
in
the
last
Congress
running
the
Veterans
Affairs
committee.
But
he
did
not
take
a
position
on
a
new
AUMF.
The
debate
about
that,
for
now,
is
entirely
among
Republicans.
ce
member
asked
Sanders
if
he
favored
a
new
authorization
of
military
force
to
define
(and
limit)
the
current
campaign
against
ISIS,
Sanders
largely
dodged
the
question.
