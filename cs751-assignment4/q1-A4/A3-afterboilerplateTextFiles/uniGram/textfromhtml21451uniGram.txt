regularly
I
do
lip
rolls
(after
an
initial
few
minutes
I
lip
roll
to
a
couple
of
songs
with
varying
vocal
ranges)
and
vocal
fry
and
one
or
two
others
that
are
hard
to
explain
in
words
(ha)
as
these
have
worked
in
getting
me
ready
to
go.
But
I
sometimes
wonder
if
singing
as
much
as
I
do,
with
many
songs
having
a
significant
vocal
range,
i.e.
NY
NY,
My
Way,
Beyond
the
Sea
and
Mack
the
Knife
and
although
I
don't
strain,
these
are
the
first
songs
to
go
when
I
start
experiencing
any
vocal
issues..
so
I
would
love
to
do
exercises
that
would
prevent
vocal
issues
if
at
all
possible.
let
me
know
the
next
step.
Thanks!
