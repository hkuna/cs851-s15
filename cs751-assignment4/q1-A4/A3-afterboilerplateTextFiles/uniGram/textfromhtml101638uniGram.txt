5.
Set
more
than
one
goal.
I
have
trouble
following
this
advice,
but
I
know
it’s
good.
Achieving
goals
in
other
arenas
of
your
life
--
like
fitness
and
health
--
will
keep
you
happy
and
give
you
confidence.
You
can
complete
what
you
set
out
to
do.
It’s
just
a
matter
of
time!
You’ll
feel
less
pressure
to
succeed
at
work
if
you
have
other
things
going
for
you.
And
what
you
learn
about
achieving
your
goals
in
other
arenas
will
inform
your
professional
aims.
With
that
in
mind,
don’t
forget
to
congratulate
yourself!
consumed
by
your
ambitions.
In
my
opinion,
that’s
no
real
way
to
live.
