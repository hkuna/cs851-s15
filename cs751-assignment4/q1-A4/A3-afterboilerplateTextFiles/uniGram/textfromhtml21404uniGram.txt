GETHSEMANE
A
type
of
Gethsemane.
Not
so
much
the
pain
â€“
more
the
agony.
Not
the
absence
of
sleep
â€“
more
the
ache;
an
ache
which
penetrates
each
sinew.
If
only
one
had
slept
like
others
do.
Oh,
how
youâ€™d
love
that
luxury.
Wait
for
the
next
event
â€“
everything
burns,
each
pore
secretes
anxiety.
Has
it
all
come
to
this?
Who
knows
what
follows
the
restless
night.

ACCORDION
Sometimes
I
feel
like
an
accordion
squeezed
by
some
disembodied
self
each
chord
vibrates
bruised
reeds
each
inspiration
teases
out
a
latent
voice
-
rarely
to
be
sustained
-
almost
as
if
it
chokes
on
its
own
respiration.

THE
BODY
SNATCHERS
The
body
snatchers
called
and
found
me
void
â€“
where
once
there
was
a
vibrant
heart,
and
thoughts
teemed
endlessly
around
-
a
residue
of
aches
and
pains
delineates
the
core
-
and
Sisyphus
rejoices
to
have
found
a
new
companion.

BEING
God
spoke
â€“
I
dare
not
listen.
I
could
not
face
the
stillness
of
simply
being
there.
God
spoke:
there
were
no
words
â€“
I
simply
saw
the
suffering
of
others.
I
could
not
share
the
stillness
of
simply
being
there.
One
day
I
knew
God
could
not
speak
-
I
used
my
eyes,
I
saw
and
felt
the
suffering
of
multitudes
â€“
I
listened
to
their
cries
â€“
then
cautiously
I
whispered
â€œI
am
hereâ€?
and
from
my
helplessness
I
knew
-
that
God
was
there.

AUBADE
(sans
le
soleil)
Wrapped
futilely
in
the
realm
of
beauty
sleep
â€“
dawn
rarely
dawns
on
me.
Long
after
the
appointed
hour,
the
room
is
thunder-black
-
draw
back
the
curtains.
The
sky
has
lost
its
breathing
space
â€“
choked
by
the
clouds,
voluptuously
hanging
in
their
mourning
drapes
â€“
symbolic
of
a
troubled
world.
I
sigh,
and
seek
the
duvetâ€™s
solace
â€“
for
me
the
day
has
not
yet
quite
begun.

CONSULTATION
These
visits
are
by
now
routine
-
on
entering
the
lion's
den,
expect
a
smile
and
beckoning
wave
to
take
a
seat.
Obediently,
you
sit
and
start
to
contemplate
time's
passage.
Words
fail,
as
always,
to
express
the
visit's
raison
d'etre.

EMERGING
and
this
morning
still
abed
my
legs
are
mercury
laden
knitted
lead
the
arms
folded
or
stretched
scream
out
for
postures
new
Restless
Night
frantic
and
static
collude
to
break
the
spirit
-
the
chorussed
scream
of
roll
and
stretch
weaves
counterpoint
against
the
searing
ache
of
stasis
-
the
chinese
burn
of
movement
resists
the
planned
escape

ON
REFLECTION
Sunshine
on
puddled
rain
reflects
the
pride
of
plants
refreshed
by
elemental
forces
it
lifts
my
spirits
I
hope
they
won't
evaporate
as
I
bask
calmly
in
the
afterglow.

Flutter
By
Moment
it
alights
softer
than
a
whisper
on
my
sleeve
almost
as
if
it
sought
me
out
I
sit
relax
breathe
in
the
gentle
air
-
the
butterfly
spreads
out
its
wings
-
this
moment
I
am
at
one
with
nature
sharing
the
fragility
imagining
a
place
where
all
could
feel
secure
-
wearing
the
butterfly
like
a
heart
on
my
sleeve

RECLAMATION
Just
another
lightly
throbbing
gritty
grey
day
a
second
chance
to
modify
oneâ€™s
outlook
divert
oneâ€™s
gaze
away
from
the
reality
-
begin
to
play
the
game
of
life
regained.

SPLASH
INTO
SPRING
A
sprinkling
splash,
a
sudden
flash
of
ruddy
gold
-
the
first
spring
stirrings.
A
long,
slow,
turgid
rest
supplanted
by
these
vital
chimes.
Today
they
share
the
sunshine's
joy
-
and
ripple
wilfully.
Last
seasons
debris
stirred
and
shaken,
the
fish
escape
their
sedimentary
rest,
herald
the
promise
of
brighter
days
to
come.
Like
me,
they
must
have
felt
they'd
plumbed
the
depths
for
far
too
long.

RUDE
AWAKENING
The
telephonic
shrill
urgents
me
blearily
into
dawn.
Discomfited
I
roll
myself
across
a
seeming
endless
counterpane,
set
foot
on
an
insecure
floor,
retrieve
the
handset
and
receive
a
droning
earful.
Bliss
was
it
in
that
dawn
to
be
asleep,
to
be
awakened
serves
to
remind
oneself
theyâ€™re
far
from
heaven.

A
PALE
REFLECTION
The
shadows
of
the
taller
trees
cast
silhouettes
across
the
pool
-
they
overlay
a
pale
reflection
of
the
more
immediate
scene.
Sometimes
I
fail
to
grasp
immediate
delights
allow
my
darker
memories
to
shield
me
from
the
light.

SHATTERED
he
rails
exhaustedly
against
the
unrelenting
night
-
shattered
by
restlessness
he
groans
a
welcome
to
a
new
daybreak
prays
that
it's
not
an
uninvited
dream
-
still
rails
against
the
unrelenting
night
then
collapses
into
sleep

just
another
day
striving
to
ignore
the
sundry
aches
and
pains
the
flesh
is
heir
to
I
sit
and
watch
the
rains
incessant
flow
â€“
birds
flit
from
shrubbery
to
feeders
wallow
in
puddle
baths
-
I
struggle
with
a
vague
desire
to
don
a
coat
wonder
if
I
dare
venture
out
to
taste
the
sodden
air
