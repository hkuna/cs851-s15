Now
what
to
do?
While
discussing
our
situation,
we
heard
a
truck
in
the
far
distance.
Luckily
it
was
driving
our
way
and
Demelash
stopped
it
to
explain
our
situation.
The
men
were
willing
to
help
for
1000
bir.
Alexandra
got
really
angry
and
was
scolding
them.
Her
argument
was
that
we
helped
other
Ethiopian
people
a
lot
and
now
when
we
need
help
they
demand
extraordinary
amounts
of
money.
BUT
this
is
Africa
as
well.
I
offered
300
birr
and
finally
for
500
birr
they
towed
us
the
100
meter
that
were
necessary
to
continue
back.
Demelash
meant
that
was
the
worst
spot,
we
would
manage
it
now
back
until
Jinka.
These
situations
happen
frequently
on
an
African
trip,
where
you
have
to
bargain
hard,
although
you
are
in
troubles.
It
was
still
30
km
back
to
our
campsite,
I
considered
changing
the
tires
but
decided
against
it,
so
we
continued
on
the
carcass,
had
to
cross
a
river
and
in
Jinka
we
tried
to
get
tires
but
they
were
not
available
in
our
size.
So
we
had
to
change
tires
and
continue
without
spare
wheels,
which
might
be
rather
risky
in
this
area.
Back
at
the
hotel
I
changed
both
front
tires,
so
we
had
only
these
two
ruined
tires
as
spares.
I
thought
that
at
least
for
emergency
they
would
make
the
job
and
we
would
try
to
get
tires
in
Turmi
next
day.
Lesson:
Never
go
without
two
spare
wheels,
we
were
glad
we
had.
