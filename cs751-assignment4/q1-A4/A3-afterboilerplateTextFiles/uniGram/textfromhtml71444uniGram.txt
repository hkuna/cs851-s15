As
we
go
about
our
day
today,
let
us
try
to
remember
what
it
means
to
be
kind
â€“
and,
what
it
means
to
be
unkind.
Let
us
remember
that
the
little
things
we
do
(like
rolling
our
eyes
or
laughing
at
gossip)
can
be
perceived
as
very
hurtful,
while
other
little
kindnesses
(like
welcoming
a
new
friend
or
smiling
at
someone
in
the
hall)
are
a
reflection
of
you.
Let
us
trade
out
unkind
actions
for
kind
actions.
Let
us
be
aware
that
what
this
fictional
principal
said
to
his
students
is
something
we
should
carry
with
us
â€“
that
â€œitâ€™s
not
enough
to
be
kindâ€?;
that
we
â€œshould
be
kinder
than
needed,â€?
â€œkinder
than
is
necessary.â€?
And,
let
us
remember
that
by
offering
kindness
to
our
neighbor,
we
in
turn
follow
the
commandment
to
love
one
another,
we
demonstrate
how
you
loved
us,
and
we
demonstrate
that
we
are
your
disciples.
