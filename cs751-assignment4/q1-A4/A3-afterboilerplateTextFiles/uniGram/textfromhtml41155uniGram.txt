What
a
fabulous
idea!!
Not
sure
what
size
your
cards
will
be
but
it
would
also
be
great
to
take
the
Shabbos/Holiday
candle
blessing
and
hand
washing
blessing
cards
and
laminate
them–
and
have
additional
ones
to
the
set
so
they
could
be
say
3″x
5″
or
4″
x
6″
and
put
on
little
lucite
easels.
That
way
you
can
have
the
candle
blessing
sit
by
your
shabbos/
holiday
candlesticks
and
the
hand
washing
blessing
sit
near
the
sink.
Love
the
graphics!!!
