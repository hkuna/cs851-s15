This
is
a
really
exciting
story
with
many
twists
and
turns.
The
complex
plot
keeps
you
on
your
toes,
I
found
it
compelling
reading,
and
once
I
had
started
page
turning,
I
couldnâ€™t
stop
until
I
had
finished
it.
For
science
fiction
fans
and
those
fascinated
with
time
travel
the
theories
in
this
book
are
fascinating
and
I
would
highly
recommend
it.
