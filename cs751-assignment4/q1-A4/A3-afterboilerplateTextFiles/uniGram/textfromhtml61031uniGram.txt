â€œShe
lived
with
purpose,
and
we
will
work
every
day
to
honor
her
legacy.
Our
hearts
are
breaking
for
our
only
daughter,
but
we
will
continue
on
in
peace,
dignity,
and
love
for
her.
We
remain
heartbroken,
also,
for
the
families
of
the
other
captives
who
did
not
make
it
home
safely
and
who
remain
in
our
thoughts
and
prayers.
We
pray
for
a
peaceful
resolution
of
the
conflict
in
Syria.â€?
