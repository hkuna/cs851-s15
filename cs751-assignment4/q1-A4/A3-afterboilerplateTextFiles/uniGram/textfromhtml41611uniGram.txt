Fast
for
JusticeIn
memory
of
the
students
murdered
by
the
Maduro
regime
I
will
be
initiating
a
fast
beginning
at
7:00pm
on
February
11,
2015
and
ending
24
hours
later.
At
the
same
time
will
be
following
events
in
Venezuela
and
praying
for
Bassil
Alejandro
Dacosta
and
Robert
Redman
both
shot
in
the
head,
hours
apart,
by
regime
agents
on
February
12,
2014.
The
body
count
would
continues
to
rise,
along
with
acts
of
torture
and
arbitrary
detentions
by
government
authorities
and
paramilitaries
in
their
service.
