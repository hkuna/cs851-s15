To
safeguard
better
the
strategic
long-term
interests
of
The
West
in
the
war
against
Islamic
terrorism,
US
politicians
should
keep
a
copy
of
â€œThe
Princeâ€?,
written
by
Niccolo
Machiavelli,
on
their
night
tables.
He
had
the
following
advice
to
those
working
in
the
spying
profession:â€?If
you
need
to
injure
someone,
do
it
in
such
a
way
that
you
do
not
have
to
fear
their
vengeance.â€?
Meaning,
next
time
you
interrogate
an
Islamic
terrorist,
while
you
are
waging
a
war,
donâ€™t
send
him
to
Guantanamo.
Finish
the
work
by
expediting
his
transition
(with
extreme
prejudice)
from
this
earthly
journey
to
Allahâ€™s
heavenly
kingdom,
and
let
the
jihadi
discover
if
he
is
getting
72
virgins
or
a
72-year-old
virgin.
It
is
the
only
method
that
will
minimize
acts
of
vengeance
and
improve
your
chances
of
survival
in
the
war.
