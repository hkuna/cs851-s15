"Want
to
change
the
world
in
one
generation?
Every
parent
should
read
and
share
The
Girl
God
with
their
children...
and
with
their
hurting
inner
child.
It
is
full
of
stunning
artistic
illustrations
by
artist
Elisabeth
Slettnes.
Both
have
collaborated
in
this
extraordinary
gift
to
humanity.
A
true
masterpiece!"
