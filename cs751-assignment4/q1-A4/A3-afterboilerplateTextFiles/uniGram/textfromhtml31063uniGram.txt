Your
voice
is
instrumental
in
urging
members
of
the
U.S.
Congress
to
put
human
rights
at
the
center
of
U.S.
foreign
policy.
We
can
push
Congress
to
tell
the
Saudi
Arabian
government
that
not
everyone
is
happy
with
"business
as
usual."
It
is
time
to
end
the
repression
in
Saudi
Arabia,
once
and
for
all.
