Pruitt-Igoe
Housing
Development
earned
the
title
‘the
most
notorious
failure
in
the
history
of
public
housing’.
Low-income
residents
described
the
building
as
‘inherently
prison-like’
causing
mental
health
problems
and
issues
of
racism
among
occupants.
Less
than
20
years
after
its
completion
the
building
was
demolished,
and
has
since
been
featured
in
architecture
lectures
as
an
example
of
‘what
not
to
do’
in
urban
design.
