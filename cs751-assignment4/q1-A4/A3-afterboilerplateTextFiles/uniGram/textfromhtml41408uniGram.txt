Just
like
us,
the
monarch
butterfly
sometimes
gets
sick
thanks
to
a
nasty
parasite.
But
biologist
Jaap
de
Roode
noticed
something
interesting
about
the
butterflies
he
was
studying
â€”
infected
female
butterflies
would
choose
to
lay
their
eggs
on
a
specific
kind
of
plant
that
helped
their
offspring
avoid
getting
sick.
How
do
they
know
to
choose
this
plant?
Think
of
it
as
â€œthe
other
butterfly
effectâ€?
â€”
which
could
teach
us
to
find
new
medicines
for
the
treatment
of
human
disease.
