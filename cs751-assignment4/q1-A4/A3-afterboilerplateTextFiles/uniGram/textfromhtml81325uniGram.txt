Rob
Lay,
a
security
expert
at
Fujitsu,
said
businesses
should
not
rely
on
insurance
to
protect
themselves
from
a
cyber
attack.
â€œWhile
insurance
may
help
mitigate
some
of
the
financial
impact
of
a
security
incident
or
breach,
the
reputational
impact
and
the
impact
to
the
business
operation
cannot
be
mitigated
with
insurance
in
the
same
way,â€?
he
said
in
a
news
release.
