This
app
does
not
allow
you
to
display
photos
in
â€œportraitâ€?
view.
It
only
shows
the
photos
in
â€œlandscapeâ€?
view.
This
means
if
you
want
to
use
your
iPad
as
a
photo
frame
and
dock
it,
it
will
display
all
your
photos
rotated
90
degrees.
Sure,
the
app
lets
you
individually
edit
every
photo
and
rotate
it
relative
to
the
landscape
view,
but
this
is
hardly
convenient
when
you
want
to
quickly
throw
100+
photos
up
on
your
iPad
as
a
photo
frame.
This
app
is
loaded
with
all
sorts
of
useless
features,
but
lacks
basic
functionality
for
â€œslideshows,â€?
even
though
â€œslideshowâ€?
is
in
the
appâ€™s
name!
For
this
I
paid
$4.
I
havenâ€™t
hated
an
app
this
much
in
a
long
time.
Avoid!!!
