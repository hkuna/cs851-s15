I
am
a
children's
book
author
and
a
freelance
writer.
My
new
children's
book
was
just
published
in
May
by
Headline
Kids
(a
division
of
Headline
Books,
Inc.)
and
is
meant
to
empower
children,
parents
and
teachers
to
keep
children
safe
from
abduction
or
predator
harm.
The
book
was
recently
honored
with
the
Best
Books
Award
Finalist
USA
Book
News.
My
newest
book,
The
Bully
and
the
Booger
Baby:
A
Cautionary
Tale,
was
published
in
June,
2013.
It
is
not
only
a
fiction
story
for
children
about
bullying
in
schools,
but
it
is
also
informational
with
strategies
for
children,
parents,
and
schools
to
help
them
better
deal
with
bullying.
Information
about
both
books,
purchase
links
and
endorsements
for
them,
as
well
as
useful
resources
can
be
accessed

my
book
