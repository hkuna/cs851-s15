Back

Tuesdayâ€¦!

it,
even
if
it
might
take
you
a
couple
of
years!
Be
open
to
taking
initiative
and
ownership
of
your
actions
and
play
for
the
team.
You
might
make
mistakes,
but
itâ€™s
important
to
admit
youâ€™ve
been
wrong.
Make
room
for
listening
as
much
as
you
want
to
make
yourself
heard.
Always
be
learning
and
show
people

unique
value
proposition.
And
be
open
(in
general)
and
honest.
Ending

my
fav
quote:
â€œNever
give
up!â€?
(smiles).
