Special
thanks
to
those
of
you
who
watch
as
well
as
anyone
who
has
ever
told
a
friend
about
my
videos;
Also
a
very
special
thanks
to
guys
like
MASTER
who
had
my
back
in
the
gaming
community
and
people
like
Michelle
Phan
and
Alphacat
who
believed
in
me
regardless
of
how
many
subscribers
I
had.
Also
for
my
parents
and
the
countless
sacrifices
they've
made
even
though
they
didn't
always
believe
in
what
I
was
doing.
