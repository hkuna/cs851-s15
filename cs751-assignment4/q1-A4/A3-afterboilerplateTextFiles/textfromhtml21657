Debbie is very calm-natured and predictable. At times, she shows signs of exploring her independence, but spends the majority of her time socializing within the herd. During the warmer seasons, Debbie can usually be found swimming in the upper pond or grazing alongside her best friend Ronnie, whom she tends to follow everywhere she goes!
Sanctuary (PAWS) in California in the spring of 2007.
