“This is tremendous news for the hard-working people of West Virginia who deserve the opportunity for a good job, especially in the Eastern Panhandle where residents will have a chance to work closer to home. Procter & Gamble’s decision to build a major manufacturing facility at the Tabler Station Business Park speaks volumes about the potential of West Virginia’s manufacturing sector and the need to invest in infrastructure projects. Ten years ago, I was proud to help obtain a federal grant for infrastructure work at the Tabler Station Business Park. I am even more proud today to see that investment led to such a major economic development project. I will continue fighting for infrastructure investments that will strengthen our economy, create jobs, and put West Virginia on the map as a manufacturing destination. Welcome to West Virginia, Procter & Gamble.”
