As if we needed a reminder of our distance from the Mars rovers, this overhead view shows the Curiosity rover (center) as a tiny gray-blue square in a sea of sand. Taken by a camera on NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the image shows Curiosity parked near the Pahrump Hills at the base of Mount Sharp. (See “Mars Curiosity Milestone: Top 5 First-Year Discoveries.”)
