I am an author excited about the release of the next novel which continues the story in my trilogy,"The Glade Series." Stay tuned for the date of publication! What? Haven't yet read A Trip, a Tryst and a Terror, Children in the Garden, or The Moment of Truth? There is a link at the top of this page where you can visit my website and order the books from Amazon. They are a must-read if the sequel, Revenge!, will make sense to you. I have also created a Facebook page, The Glade Series, if you would like to get updates there, too. These books make the perfect Christmas gifts for children and adults alike! I am blessed to be married to my wonderful Danny and blessed once again to be able to lead praise worship with him every Sunday at Kennesaw United Methodist. Together, we share four children (two "step" for each of us). We enjoy spending time with our three-year-old granddaughter, Virginia Rose, and welcomed our second granddaughter, Savannah Jane, on April 27, 2014. We also share a deep love and commitment to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit and rejoice in being heirs of the Kingdom through His sacrifice.
