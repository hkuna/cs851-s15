“We want it to hit hard, and not just in a music aspect, but meaning-wise too," says vocalist Keaton Pierce. "Every transition of song, every word, every note that’s played, we want people to feel something from it. There are no gaps in songs where we just throw something there because we need something to go there. Everything’s carefully placed and planned to keep the listener entranced. We want it to be a different experience than just somebody listening to a record. It’s a story that you tell."
