Stephen Williams, the minister for communities, said the government “actively supports” allotments. “Where we have consented to the disposal of allotments, alternative plots have been provided. Surveys too by the National Allotment Society show that over 2,000 new allotment places have been created in last few years, and allotment waiting times have fallen.”
