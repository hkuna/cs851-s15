I’ve been tweeting with the hashtag #28DaysAreNotEnough. We should be talking about these things outside of Black History Month. If anyone wants to post any stories about Black History, post them with the hashtag #28DaysAreNotEnough.
Jackie Robinson — sort of the ‘Greatest Hits’ of Black History — you don’t have time for the other stories. Then we go back to “regular history.” When in reality, African-American history is American history, and we need to incorporate the American mythos and the idea of Black History into every day history in a more intertwined way.
