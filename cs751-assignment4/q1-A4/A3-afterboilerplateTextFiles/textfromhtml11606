I have been exhausted from my crazy schedule and I KNEW I wasn't spending enough time with The Lord. This post has motivated me (yet again) to make sure I spend time with Jesus before I go running off doing my thing. I need to seek Him to make sure my schedule satisfies The Father. Thank you for writing this ! God bless Xo
