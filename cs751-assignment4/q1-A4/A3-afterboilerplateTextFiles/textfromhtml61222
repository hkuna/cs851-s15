We've teamed up with Deep RiverRock to give one lucky person a meal for two in The Morrison Hotel 5 Star Restaurant on Valentine's Day to get yourself out of the bad books. All you've got to do is comment below or email hello@lovindublin.com with the biggest or most embarrassing thing you did on Valentine's when you weren't thinking straight. The funnier or more ridiculous the better!
