Shannon Anderson is a blogger who uses her humble platform to inspire humanity in a return to Love. She's a believer in Divine Synchronicity and all things that are Good, Beautiful, and True. Colorado is where she lives but the world is Shannon's home, for that is where her heart is. Burstintolove.com was born from a grand yearning within her spirit for others to discover who they really are and why they are here. A wish for everyone to hear the call, the sweet soul whisper of the Creator, so that they may â€‹remember the Love which is already theirs. That every heart spark may be ignited, all around the globe. This was published here on Awakening People with the author's explicit written permission.
