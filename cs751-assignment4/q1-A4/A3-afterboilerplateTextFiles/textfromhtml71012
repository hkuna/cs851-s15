I've actually done this last week. The email address linked to my google profile was a yahoo email and I've been using it ever since. When I comment on other blogs, I use my gmail and when I checked, the gmail address is no-reply blogger but I could still receive replies to my comments. So I'm not really sure what's happening, hehehe but I went back to just using my yahoomail to comment and reply since it's the one that's linked to my blog. Thanks for sharing this info!
