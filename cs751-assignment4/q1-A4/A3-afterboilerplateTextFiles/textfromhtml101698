Dad and Earnie made their big entrance as Al Capone with his gun moll. He wore a pin striped suit, black shirt, spats, Fedora with a red feather in it...had a scar penciled on his forehead, and carried a toy machine gun. He was of course, the life of the party and you could hear his voice and laughter above the roar of the crowd. The party was a rip roaring success and Gene and I were really happy we had a big beautiful house to entertain both our families in. Gene's stereo and speakers I'd won the money for from Santa Anita's opening day, finally had a place in the cabinet granddaddy made for him. And, the house came alive with disco music, and dancing all nignt long. However, I have to say, it was a little weird not having Nana at such a great event... with her style, laughter and love of fun, but it was also nice not having to deal with her constant demand for attention and control. She must have been there in spirit, because everyone asked about her and though nobody knew too much about what was going on in Arkansas, We all bet it included a lot of high drama.
 Mary wore her Mary costume that she wore everywhere...a Fushia colored dress suit, with a black hat, gloves and lace up granny shoes. What a character she was and she sat on the new sofa all night just watching granddaddy have fun. Finally when she couldn't stand it another minute, she said "Andy, it's time to go".
