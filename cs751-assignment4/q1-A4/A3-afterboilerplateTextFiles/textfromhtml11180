Now do I have to search for peace of mind? I know I do not have to. The only thing I have to do is live today. Peace of mind, is a question of what will happen in the future. It is an anxiety brought about by the events that has not happened yet. Although part of the problem is the change that is happening at present, but this feeling of uncertainty is due to thinking of what may happen. I know I cannot control the future. Instead, I just have to decide living today. Regardless of what the problem will be, I still have today to live. Perhaps thinking of today could ease the anxiety and attain peace of mind today. :-)
