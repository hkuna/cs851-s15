In the latest “This Is SportsCenter” commercial from ESPN, it’s revealed that two ESPN anchors were actually inside the shark costumes during Katy Perry’s halftime show during Super Bowl XLIX, as they returned to work at ESPN studios in Bristol, Connecticut. It’s a funny commercial for the time being, but there’s no way this goes down as one of the classic “This Is SportsCenter” commercials, as everyone will forget about the sharks from Katy Perry’s halftime show in a week if they haven’t already.
