Mosam and Hartdegen will attend two matches in Australia – Proteas vs India in Melbourne and Proteas vs West Indies in Sydney. They will be staying in the same hotel as the team and will get the opportunity to attend team practices, have a meal with the team and be part of the global cricket spectacle at two of the world’s most iconic cricket venues.
