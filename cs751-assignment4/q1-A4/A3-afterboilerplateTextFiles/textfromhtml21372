GOING WE ARE GOING BEYOND THE STARSAROUND THE GLOBE BEYOND THIS UNIVERSE
e only reason that most of us are dreaming Love is the only reason I’m sending out this beacon!If we really believe it why are kids left out there bleedingAnd their screaming cross the globe We just leave with the hope That they’ll make it But they don’tIt’s a shame It’s not joke That were racing to be famous But this fame could be a slopeI’ve been driving through this timeline I’m wired up to go!Chorus x2 GOING WERE GOING TO THE STARS x2BEYOND THIS UNIVERSE
