A .400 hitter and a pair of .300 swatters are back to lead the squad on offense as junior catcher Emily Isla returns after a .422 campaign. Junior second baseman Desi Hengoed, who along with Isla was a '14 All-GLIAC Honorable Mention selection, returns after posting a .379 average and leading the squad in home runs (4), RBI's (35) and slugging percentage (.621). Junior shortstop Alexa Holztrager, who tallied a .333 average with a pair of home runs, also looks to keep the 2015 offense attack on track.
