At its heart this is a G63, so power is likely to be disproportionate to handling ability. Its 5.5-litre twin-turbo V8 serves up 537bhp, and given the extra weight of all that armour cladding (as well as its extra length), we'd reckon a lot of those horses will be munched up by the traction control if you arrive too ambitiously at a corner.
