Inside, the Sport Pack adds cloth and leather trim, a JCW multi-function steering wheel, anthracite headlining, piano black dash accents, and MINIâ€™s new Excitement Pack and Driving Modes features. The latter allows you to adjust the curves of the accelerator, steering and engine acoustics. And, where the car is fitted with the relevant equipment features, MINI Driving Modes also affects the shifting characteristics of the automatic transmission, the Dynamic Damper Control adjustable dampers, the ambient lighting and the displays in the central instrument cluster.
