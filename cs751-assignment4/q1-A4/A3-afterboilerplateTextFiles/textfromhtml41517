The only slavery I see today is the Muslims in Africa kidnapping girls and selling them.ISIS kidnapping girls and selling them to other Muslims. Is this not slavery? I am against slavery, but why are fingers pointed at me and other whites for something that happened before I was born. Should I be ashamed of being white? I don’t think so. I’m a Republican and is it so that the slave owners were Dixie-crats? KKK= Democrats? Abraham Lincoln=Republican=freed the slaves? Wasn’t it a Republican that pushed the Civil Rights Bill? Oh BTW I’m a Christian!
