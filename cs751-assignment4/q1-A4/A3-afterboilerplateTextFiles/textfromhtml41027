en, I may have bought a lemon. I've gotten a couple of quotes so far. And both mechanics are giving me close to 3k or more. I'm devastated! Im stuck with the van because I can't afford a new car. I am a single mother of two kids and only receiving veteran disability. I need your help raising the repair money. I have a lot of appointments at the VA Hospital and I'm scared the van will have my children and I stranded anywhere. I suffer from major depression, ptsd, injuries that have me in constant pain and anxiety/panic attacks. Thank you for reading my story. If you are unable to donate, word of mouth or information will help out tremendously.
