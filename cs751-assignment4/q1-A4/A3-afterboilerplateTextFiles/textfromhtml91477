Rarely do I get on soap boxes but man this burned me up. Trying to eat healthy lunch. Went to #panerabread and ordered sandwich. To my new found knowledge you can't eat just a sandwich. You have to order a $10 combo. Well she said chips or fruit? I said fruit cup that was on the counter. She said that cost more, how about an apple (size of tangerine) I said yes. She said what to drink. I said water or water bottle since it was To go. She said water bottle cost more. So she took away my normal cup and told me to use water cups. ( large Dixie cup). This is a scam that you can not order just a sandwich. Last time at Panera Bread â€” at Panera Bread.
