Shaping the culture of the firm is the real and most significant challenge that every firm regulated by the FCA is going to have to meet. Any technological solution has a number of characteristics and capabilities that need to work together to support the changing and sustaining of a new culture. Furthermore, any solution should enable the firm to deploy individual human capital scorecards across the firm. By using personal objectives and KPIs the firm can create clear performance expectations and remove any uncertainty an individual may have about what they are expected to deliver and achieve in the new organisation.
