After a very tiring second day in Bangkok, we can say we had a good overview of the Thai culture, food and the people. Although, it was not a perfectly planned and implemented stopover, I can say that it was a worthwhile and memorable experience for my sister and I. I myself would love to come back in Thailand after a significant period of time.
 that I was already 27 years old.
