l that our governments tell us.It is very encouraging that this movie even got made.Viewers have come a long way from the 70's and earlier when the rah-rah fawning sycophant factor was a much greater percentage of the public than it is now.We've got a long way to go,but it looks like were are catching on.Hooray.Go see this one.It points out what we are up against.The acting is quite good;especially Bana and Broadbent.The closed circuit TV's are an interesting analogy to explain the understandable paranoia of the people in charge.They should be paranoid.If enough people figure out what's really going on;all the cameras in the world won't save them.
