"(Svedberg) said he felt better and better every game," said coach Claude Julien. "Our goal was to give him some games. He hadn’t played much and I felt it was unfair to him and to our team to throw him in when he was out so long or hadn’t played much. It was a great opportunity for him to go there and play a lot of games."
