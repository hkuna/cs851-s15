National Health Insurance Scheme will subsidise premium for community-based schemes for pregnant women and children under age five in efforts to push up coverage. The subsidized health packages will last three years, according to NHIS chief executive Dr Femi Thomas.It came as the scheme flagged off Community-Based Social Health Insurance for communities in Gwiwa Sire, in Wamakko Local Government Area of Sokoto State.According to him, the scheme has spent more than N1.2b to provide care for pregnant women and children below 5 years of age under an maternal and child health programme since 2008 in six council areas of Sokotoâ€”Kebbe, Yabo, Binji, Tangaza, Sabon-Birni and Isa.Speaking at the occasion, the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Gwiwa Sire Mutual Health Association, Abubakar Usman Basakwace called on the state government to provide the association with a piece of land to build a healthcare facility within the community, in order to bring healthcare services to the door steps of their members.In his reaction, the Governor of Sokoto State, Aliyu Wamakko, who was represented by the Commissioner for Livestock and Animal Health, Garba Sanda, assured that Sokoto state would partner with NHIS to bring the benefits of health insurance to the people of the state.Several communities across the country are at various stages of preparedness for the formal take-off of the community based social health insurance programme, evidence that the worrisome apathy to health insurance is abating rapidly across the country.
