The Four Diamonds Fund provides the ability to offset the costs of cancer treatment not covered by insurance, taking the pressure off the families. Additionally, the Fund hires world-class medical specialists as part of its cancer-fighting team, including child life specialists, and clinical nutritionists. The Fund has also established multiple research endowments that impact children across the nation, including a research program that will allow for Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, bringing us one step closer to a cure. It is this type of care and research that has ranked Penn State Hershey Children’s Hospital one of the best in the country for cancer care by the U.S. News & World Report Best Children’s Hospital Rankings. Thanks to THON’s donors, we are making a difference in the lives of children and families, taking more steps towards a cure! For The Kids!
