So when the astronomically high box office numbers for “Fifty Shades of Grey” roll in this Friday, don’t expect me to be surprised. There is a clear thirst for diverse depictions of female experience on screen, one that isn’t being met by the paltry offerings Hollywood is putting forward. (And isn’t necessarily being sated by TV’s diverse landscape of rich female roles, either.) The numbers don’t lie: Jennifer Lopez’s “Boy Next Door” was by all accounts not a good movie, but viewers showed up in droves, with the film ultimately grossing over eight times its original budget. Anastasia Steele may not exactly be a feminist hero, but she’s a real woman with a set of unique goals and desires, whose billing isn’t “wife” or “sexy co-ed number 2″ or “Katniss Everdeen.” Her story matters. We might be a long way from seeing femininity represented all its myriad hues and shades, but at least “Fifty Shades” is a start.
