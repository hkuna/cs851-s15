"In the past, studies trying to understand the signs associated with impending death were conducted in people who were recognized as dying," Hui noted. "With our study, we observed a list of signs in patients from the time they were admitted to the palliative care unit. They were observed systematically, twice a day, without knowing if the patient would die or be discharged." This lack of bias from the start, Hui explained, suggests the current study is more credible.
