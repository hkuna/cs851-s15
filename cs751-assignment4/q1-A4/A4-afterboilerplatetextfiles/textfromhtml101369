I have loved peaches-and-cream pie for years – happy to stumble on your recipe and as soon as peaches are again in season I’m anxious to try it. Don’t know how I will endure the months waiting for that as this is only January but I’ll try!
re brave, give it a try. Let me know how it works out if you do!
