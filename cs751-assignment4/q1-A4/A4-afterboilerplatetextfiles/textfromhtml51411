One detail that has us scratching our head a little is the phone’s SoC. It’s not explicitly named here, but Sony’s spec pages identify the GPU as an Adreno 330 – which last time we checked, was only in Snapdragon 800-series models. We had previously heard that the E4 could run a MediaTek MT6582, and while that would make sense with the 1.3GHz clock speed given here, that SoC uses a different GPU. We’re reaching out to Sony for clarification. Update: No word from Sony just yet, but a white paper for the E4 identifies the SoC as a MediTek MT6582 with Mali-400 MP2 GPU – we’re assuming mention of the Adreno 330 was in error. Update 2: Sony’s confirmed with us that the Adreno stuff (as well as a stray mention of Lollipop) was a mistake – the E4 runs a MediaTek SoC and ships with KitKat.
