When snow fell on the Dutch town of Haarlem last week (that’s Haarlem, not Harlem, FYI), the roof of one house was left suspiciously bare. Was it because of the massive amounts of heat generated by the heat lamps need to grow the plants? Taking the weather’s hint, police raided the property and found cannabis production on an industrial scale.
