The HexCell Steel light is made from thin, contoured, blackened brake-formed steel with Edison lightbulbs in the spirit of the existing building, while the HexCell Fabric is a lightweight tensile ceiling structure. Made of ordinary and inexpensive non-woven mesh, the ceiling was designed using a physics modeler so that the flexible fabric is pulled taut equally in all directions, creating a geometrically precise but diffuse light effect in the room. In each case, as with the stair and platform, these installations attempt to defy the predictable qualities of the ordinary materials of which they are made.
