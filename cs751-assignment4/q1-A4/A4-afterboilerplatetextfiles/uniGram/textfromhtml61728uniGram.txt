So
after
much
deliberation
--
way
more
than
I
should've
given
to
a
prediction
this
far
ahead
of
the
season
--
here's
how
I
combined
the
four
factors,
with
a
little
intuition.
ce
Davis
say
for
about
15
years:
"If
you're
not
good
enough,
a
loss
will
find
you."
Not
to
mention,
the
selection
committee's
job
is
to
identify
the
best
teams,
and
that's
not
necessarily
the
ones
with
the
fewest
losses.
