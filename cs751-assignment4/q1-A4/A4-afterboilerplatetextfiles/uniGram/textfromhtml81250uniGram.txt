Cookie
dough
sandwiched
between
two
baked
cookies?!?!
Holy
cow
â€“
are
you
serious?
Thatâ€™s
like
my
dream
dessert!
Oh,
and
then
you
went
and
added
in
that
little
idea
about
some
vanilla
ice
cream!
Yes,
yes!
Sign
me
up!!!

t
the
crust.
I
loooove
pie
crust,
but
last
time
I
made
a
chocolate
pie
with
a
regular
pie
crust,
I
thought
â€˜Meh.
Wouldâ€™ve
been
better
with
a
graham
cracker
crust.â€™
