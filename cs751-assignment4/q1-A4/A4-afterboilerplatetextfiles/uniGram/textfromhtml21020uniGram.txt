More
for
after
the
book’s
written
and
they
hope
to
sell
it
–
I’ve
realized
by
looking
at
tons
of
books
through
blog
hops
and
just
general
reviews
how
important
the
cover
design
is
to
me.
We
have
a
digital
library
as
part
of
Seattle
Public
Library,
and
I
browse
all
the
time
looking
for
new
things.
The
covers
have
to
be
polished
to
get
me
to
even
open
up
the
page
and
read
the
description.
If
it
looks
amateurish,
I
tend
to
skip
over
it.
Or,
if
it’s
got
a
hot
guy
without
a
shirt
on
on
the
cover,
I
tend
to
skip.
Whenever
I’ve
tried
those
kinds
of
books,
it
seems
like
the
authors
focus
more
on
the
sex
scenes
than
the
rest
of
the
story,
like
they’re
just
filling
pages
between
them
to
get
it
to
a
book
length.
I’ve
seen
too
many
books
where,
if
it’s
in
first
person,
the
speaker’s
tone
just
completely
changes
and
it
feels
like
a
different
character.
I
don’t
have
a
problem
with
content,
I
just
don’t
like
feeling
like
I’m
yanked
out
of
the
story.
I’m
probably
overlooking
some
books
that
are
actually
pretty
great
filtering
like
this,
but
there
are
so
many
other
options
to
read
now
that
I
just
don’t
take
the
time.
You
know?
Or
maybe
I’m
way
more
superficial
when
selecting
a
book
to
read
than
others.
