4.8
million
people
have
been
harassed
by
the
Work
Capability
Assessment,
a
million
plus
have
been
sanctioned
and
hundreds
of
thousand
ended
up
on
various
slave
labour
schemes.
If
they
voted
Tory
before
the
experience,
I
doubt
they
are
going
to
now.
if
it
was
only
â€œother
peopleâ€?
that
had
been
affected.
