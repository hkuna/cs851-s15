Again,
assuming
all
other
duties
are
performed
well,
I
really
do
not
see
a
problem

others
duties
beyond
their
job

ause
the
company
no
longer
existed.
I
said,
“No,
because
it’s
not
about
the
company
but
the
people.
What
I
taught
people
they
can
apply
anywhere.
If
they
choose,
they
can
take
it
with
them.
I
even
had
one
participant
call
me
eight
years
later
to
use
a
presentation
I
made
for
his
current
employer.
He
liked
it
so
much
he
hunted
me
down.
There
are
few
callings
more
important
than
helping
another
human
being
improve
herself.
