â€œDonâ€™t
Kill
the
Funâ€?
features
Chris
Brown,
who
harmonizes
quite
nicely
with
Streeter.
In
fact,
they
go
together
so
well
that
Brown
directed
the
video
for
â€œDonâ€™t
Kill
the
Fun,â€?
which
sends
both
Brown
and
Streeter
into
an
old-school
dance
battle
on
a
graffiti-soaked
rooftop.
Streeter
gets
to
show
off
some
slick
moves,
and
between
her
dancing
and
her
super-cool
coo,
itâ€™s
no
wonder
she
cites
the
late
Aaliyah
as
a
major
influence.
