The
research
comes
at
the
same
that
time
the
White
House
is
pushing
new
rules
for
America's
flood-prone
buildings,
which
put
climate
science
at
the
center
of
federal
regulations.
At
the
end
of
last
month,
President
Obama
issued
an
executive
order
to
implement
a
new
"Federal
Flood
Risk
Management
Standard,"
designed
to
reduce
risks
and
cut
the
costs
of
future
flood
disasters.
But
the
president's
plan
is
being
met
by
Republican
oppositionâ€”mainly
from
senators
whose
states
border
the
Gulf
of
Mexico.
These
lawmakers
question
the
legality
of
the
executive
order
and
imply
that
the
White
House
didn't
do
enough
to
solicit
input
before
drafting
the
order.
