If
stymied
on
disclosure,
action
could
move
to
Congress,
with
legislative
action
to
ban
these
windfall
payments
that
make
the
revolving
door
more
attractive.
â€œAt
a
time
when
people
are
worried
about
the
over-representation
of
Wall
Street
in
policymaking
positions,
we
see
that
the
revolving
door
is
baked
into
the
compensation
structure,â€?
said
Michael
Smallberg
of
POGO,
â€œItâ€™s
worth
considering
whether
these
provisions
should
be
banned
altogether.â€?
