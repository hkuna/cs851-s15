Obesity
has
become
a
life
threatening
health
issue
today.
Adults
are
not
the
only
ones
battling
the
problem.
Children
and
teenagers
have
also
become
largely
overweight
due
to
faulty
eating
and
lifestyle
habits.
Correcting
diet
habits
and
exercising
regularly
are
sure-fire
methods
to
lose
weight.
However,
how
long
it
might
take
to
drop
a
significant
amount
of
weight
using
these
two
measures
depends
upon
your
bodyâ€™s
constitution.
