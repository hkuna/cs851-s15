Of
course,
a
similar
attack
did
strike
the
US.
But
instead
of
hitting
the
US
oil
industry
or
a
similarly
critical
sector,
it
struck
a
Hollywood
film
studio.
And
instead
of
coming
from
Iran,
it
came
this
time
(according
to
the
White
House
and
FBI)
from
North
Korea.
All
of
which
suggests
that
when
the
US
and
Israeli
strike
their
enemies,
it
isnâ€™t
just
that
single
adversary
who
learns
from
the
attack.
