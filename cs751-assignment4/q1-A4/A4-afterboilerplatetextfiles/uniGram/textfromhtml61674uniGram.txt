"An
unspoken
bargain
is
struck
between
the
president
and
the
nation
in
which
he
is
expected
to
lie
to
the
public
and
the
public
is
expected
to
wink
back
in
response,"
writes
Hot
Air's
Noah
Rothman.
"This
level
of
cynicism,
the
expectation
that
obviously
our
political
leaders
would
mislead
us
about
what
they
truly
believe,
cannot
be
healthy
in
the
long
run."
