Since
Summit
started
in
1990
I've
worked
with
thousands
of
executives
and
leaders
at
all
different
levels
on
the
org
chart.
Through
our
partnership
together
they
have
achieved
compelling
goals,
built
effective
teams,
and
discovered
inner
resources
that
they
didn't
know
they
had.
And,
by
the
way,
their
growth
resulted
in
some
nice
financial
gains,
too!
