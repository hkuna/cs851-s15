The
artwork,
narration
and
soundtrack
are
gorgeous
and
professionally
done.
The
icing
on
the
cake
is
that
the
artwork
is
done
on
muted
tones
of
parchment
paper
and
gives
the
book
a
sense
of
ancient
import
and
a
story
to
be
listened
to
or
read.
You
can
almost
feel
the
history
of
the
story
as
your
fingers
dance
along
the
page.
I
really
appreciate
how
the
interactions
are
purposeful
to
the
story
and
going
from
page
to
page
is
not
always
a
linear
process.
Children
really
need
to
tune
in,
look
and
listen
to
progress
in
the
story.
