The
plot
is
sub-Hitchhikerâ€™s
Guide/Guardians
of
the
Galaxy
bunkum
about
extravagantly
coiffured
extraterrestrials
who
rule
Earth
from
afar,
but
whose
plans
to
â€œharvestâ€?
its
riches
are
confounded
by
the
genetic
resurgence
of
intergalactic
royalty
in
the
unsuspecting
shape
of
toilet-cleaning
Mila
Kunis
(she
is
the
one!).
Channing
Tatum
is
the
wolf/man
hybrid
who
plays
Clark
Kent
to
Kunisâ€™s
Lois
Lane
(a
recurrent
Wachowski
trope),
swooping
around
on
jet-boot
rollerblades
as
we
careen
through
starship
dogfights,
massive
interplanetary
shoot-em-ups,
and
endless
incongruous
stick-on
ears.
At
one
point,
the
whole
thing
becomes
Brazil
in
space,
replete
with
a
Terry
Gilliam
cameo.
Itâ€™s
absolute
nonsense,
with
each
new
world
more
fantastically
overdressed
than
the
last,
and
dialogue
that
would
make
George
Lucas
cringe.
Top
marks
go
to
evil
space
royal
Eddie
Redmayne,
whose
breathy
ennui
is
offset
by
bouts
of
mummyâ€™s
boy
shrieking,
all
delivered
with
a
â€œpetite-mortâ€?
look
on
his
face
that
suggests
he
is
being
fellated
by
eternity
itself.
