The
Preseason
All-Sate
Showcase
took
place
on
Saturday,
February
7
at
Showtime
Baseball
Academy
in
Franklin
with
a
total
of
60
players
participating.
The
event
was
undoubtedly
the
most
talented
group
of
players
assembled
for
an
event
since
we
began
operations
in
the
state.
There
were
some
eye-opening
numbers
put
up
by
several
players
as
they
established
themselves
as
high-level
prospects.
