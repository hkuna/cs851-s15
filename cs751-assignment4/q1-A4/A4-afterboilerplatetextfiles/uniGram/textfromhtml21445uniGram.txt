heavy
and
felt
as

my
upper
range,
i
have
tried
drinking
lots
of
water

dident
feel

went
to
the
chemist

and
they
gave
me
vocalzone
lozenges.

been
having
them
every
2
hours
and
i
started
to
feel
better

of
mucas

coming
up,
now
this
evening
my
throat
feels
as
it
did
when
the
problem
first
started,
any
ideas
what
it
could
be?

taken
medicine
for
it
but
a
lot
of
it
is
still
in
my
throat.do

any
tips
for
getting
rid
of
mucus
