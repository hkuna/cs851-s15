When
Vince
Vaughnrelisted
his
five
bedroom
triplex
penthouse
in
the
landmark
Palmolive
Building
last
September,
the
A-lister
did
so
without
including
any
interior
photos
of
the
space.
However,
over
the
weekend,
the
12,000
square
foot
penthouse
publicly
listed
on
the
MLS
with
a
$1
million
price
chop
and
some
new
interior
shots.
The
penthouse
takes
up
the
top
three
floors
of
the
historic
Art
Deco
building,
a
space
that
housed
the
headquarters
of
Hugh
Hefner's
Playboy
Enterprises
from
the
mid-'60s
to
the
late
'80s.
Vaughn's
listing
agent
told
DNAinfo
that
the
actor
is
"not
desperate
in
any
way"
to
ditch
the
swanky
triplex
space,
however
with
a
million-dollar
price
cut
and
some
new
photos
Vaughn
is
certainly
offering
a
little
more
bait
to
lure
potential
buyers.
Chicago's
most
supreme
bachelor
pad
can
be
yours
for
the
stately
sum
of
$13.9
million
and
an
additional
$12,155
per
month
in
HOA
dues.
