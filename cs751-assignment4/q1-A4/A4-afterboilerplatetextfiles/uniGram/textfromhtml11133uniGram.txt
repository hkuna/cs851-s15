Fix
It:
This
is
typically
an
easy
fix--you
have
to
make
sure
that
monitoring
and
responding
appropriately
to
reviews
is
part
of
someone's
job
duty.
If
you
have
a
corporate
social
media
expert
or
strategist,
they
are
usually
a
great
option.
If
not,
consider
talking
with
your
local
franchisee
owners
and
have
them
dedicate
one
person
to
managing
the
reviews
for
their
local
business.
