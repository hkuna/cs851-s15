HARRISONBURG,
VAâ€”Saying
there
were
plenty
of
other
things
to
snack
on,
local
mom
Susan
Weiss
announced
Friday
that
she
has
a
plan
for
the
tub
of
whipped
cream
in
the
refrigerator,
so
no
one
is
allowed
to
eat
it.
â€œIâ€™m
making
a
new
recipe,
and
the
last
thing
I
want
to
see
when
I
open
that
tub
is
a
big
scoop
taken
out,â€?
said
Weiss,
adding
that
everyone
will
get
to
eat
it
on
Sunday
when
the
McCormicks
come
over.
â€œIf
thereâ€™s
any
left
over,
you
can
have
some
then.
But
if
youâ€™re
really
hungry
now,
you
can
have
those
grapes
or
heat
up
the
fajitas
from
last
night.â€?
Weiss
went
on
to
say
that
no
one
should
be
scrounging
around
the
kitchen
anyway
because
dinner
would
be
ready
in
an
hour.
