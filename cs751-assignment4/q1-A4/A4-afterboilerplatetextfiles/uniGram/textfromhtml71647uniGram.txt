After
visitng
several
local
bodyshops
I
ended
up
going
slightly
further
afield
and
using
Finishline
to
repaint
the
front
bumper
and
bonnet.
It's
a
3
stage
pearl
paint,
difficult
to
work
with
and
blend
for
many,
Finishline
did
the
work
with
absolute
perfection.
I
now
wouldn't
trust
anyone
else
with
my
cars.
Highly
recommended!"
