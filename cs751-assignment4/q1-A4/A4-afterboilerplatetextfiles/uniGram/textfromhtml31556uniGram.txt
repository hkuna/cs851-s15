Microbreweries
were
a
hot
topic
in
the
Arizona
Senate
yesterday.
Outgoing
Attorney
General
Eric
Holder
gets
asked
to
quack
like
a
duck,
while
Obama
gets
mocked
to
his
face.
Plus,
Mike
reflects
on
the
death
of
Prescott
resident
Kayla
Mueller
and
whether
or
not
the
U.S.
should
pay
for
hostages.
CBS
Military
Analyst
Major
Mike
Lyons
also
weighs
in.
