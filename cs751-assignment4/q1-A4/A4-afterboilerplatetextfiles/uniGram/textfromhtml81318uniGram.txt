Officials
in
North
Korea,
apparently
mistaking
the
regular
German
release
schedule
for
the
programme
at
this
year’s
Berlin
film
festival,
threatened
the
Berlinale
with
‘merciless
punishment’
unless
they
cancel
showings
of
The
Interview
o
released
fewer
movies
and
suffered
in
comparison
with
the
preceding
year,
when
its
television
unit
released
the
hit
show
Breaking
Bad
on
video
on
demand.
