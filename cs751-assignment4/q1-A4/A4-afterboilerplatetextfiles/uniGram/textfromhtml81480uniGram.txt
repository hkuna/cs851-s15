"I
support
the
'Voting
Counts'
initiative
in
spreading
greater
understanding
of
how
the
UK
is
governed
and,
more
importantly,
how
younger
citizens
may
actively
participate
in
our
democratic
systems.
We
need
more
sites
like
‘Voting
Counts’
in
order
to
ensure
as
many
young
people
as
possible
register
to
vote,
engage
and
act."

Storey
