I
had
to
read
the
Wikipedia
article
to
contextualize
this
scene
and
this
movie
sounds
like
hell
to
sit
through.
Guess
that's
how
things
get
nominated
for
Oscars.
Weird
Al
tries
to
improve
on
his
flawless
accordion
tootling
under
the
direction
of
J.K.
Simmons.
He
is
beaten,
but
his
spirit
is
not
broken,
even
when
he
gets
hit
by
a
chair.
