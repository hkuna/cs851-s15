LOVED
THE
ARTICLE!
It
emphasizes
1.
proactivity,
2.making
sure
you
are
in
music
for
the
right
reasons
(love
and
not
fairy
tales),
3.
being
unafraid
to
pay
some
dues,
4.
making
sure
that
if
you
are
going
to
give
out
samples
of
your
music,make
sure
that
people
understand
that
nothing
is
really
free
and
that
your
music
is
of
value,
and
5.
being
sure
to
negotiate
for
what
you
deserve.
WHAT'S
NOT
TO
LOVE?
is.
