One
Power
106
is
enough!!!
We
don't
need
another
wannabe
station
to
play
the
same
damn
thing.
In
the
first
place,
Power
106
rules
the
hip
hop
roost.
The
selection
of
music
92.3
played
was
appreciated
by
listeners
of
different
generations.
That
in
itself
speaks
volumes
of
what
a
great
station
it
was.
If
rumors
are
true,
that
these
people
look
down
on
the
type
of
music
92.3
broadcasted,
then
maybe
Jimmy
Reyes
and
the
rest
of
the
92.3
crew
are
better
off.
I
would
never
want
to
be
under
that
type
of
administration,
because
selling
out
should
never
be
an
option.
92.3
truly
was
the
only
station
of
it's
kind.
I
wish
everyone
at
92.3
all
the
best
on
their
journey
to
bigger
and
brighter
opportunities.
By
the
way,
The
Love
Affair
was
off
the
hook!!!!
Thank
you,
Art
Laboe,
Jimmy
Reyes,
Josefa
Salinas,
Rene
Taylor,
and
the
rest
of
the
92.3
crew
for
all
the
wonderful
years
of
service
to
all
your
listeners.
