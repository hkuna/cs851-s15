I
grew
up
in
East
Chicago,
Indiana,
and
at
an
early
age
I
was
introduced
to
science
fiction
by
my
parents
whom
I
miss.
When
I
was
a
kid
I
was
introduced
to
the
novel
Star
Trek:
Final
Frontier
by
Diane
Carey
and
later
on
Babylon
5
both
of
which
have
a
powerful
influence
on
the
stories
that
I
write.
For
the
past
12
years
I've
been
working
at
the
Hoosier
Theatre
in
Whiting
Indiana,
and
during
my
time
there
I've
written
13
novels,
currently
working
on
my
next
novel,
2
of
which
have
been
published
under
the
title
of
Infinite
Possibilities
of
which
the
main
title
will
now
be
changed
to
make
it
more
marketable.
One
more
thing
about
Infinite
Possibilities
it
will
continue
in
it's
new
form.
One
of
my
goals
is
to
work
with
every
major
studio
and
I
am
currently
co-writing
and
co-producing
my
first
theatrical
movie.
Which
is
leading
me
to
direct
my
first
short
film.
I
am
the
VP
and
Co-owner
of
the
production
company
Shareef
Entertainment.
