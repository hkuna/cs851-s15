of
states
put
a
new
spin
on
unique
personalized
gifts
that
honor
where
you
are
from
or
where
you
have
been
with
State
Shapes
cut
out
of
the
cutting
board
wood
to
create
our
State
Trivets.
Our
State
Shaped
Cutting
Board
Trivets
are
made
from
the
same
wood
as
our
Cutting
Boards,
butcher
block,
sustainably
harvested
hard
maple
wood.
That
is
why
we
like
to
refer
to
them
as
our
State
Shaped
Cutting
Board
Trivets!
Our
State
Shaped
Cutting
Board
Trivets
make
great
souvenirs
for

who
wants
to
think
of
home.
