of
such
a
well-known
character.
And
that
combined
with
such
a
solid
team
-
of
like
(EP
Greg)
Berlanti
and
(EP
Andrew)
Kreisberg
and
Geoff
Johns
-

guys
did
Arrow.
And
they
were
still
figuring
that
show
out
for
a
while.
And
now
I
feel
like
they're
really
tapping
into
all
they
learned
on
that
show
for
The
Flash.
Their
ability
at
crafting
these
shows
is
strengthening.
The
longer
I'm
on
the
show,
the
more
confidence
I
develop

read
the
scripts
that
are
coming
up
and
I
keep
thinking
"Wow,
the
fans
are
gong
to
go
nuts."
And
that's
a
very
good
thing.
