In
the
latest
â€œThis
Is
SportsCenterâ€?
commercial
from
ESPN,
itâ€™s
revealed
that
two
ESPN
anchors
were
actually
inside
the
shark
costumes
during
Katy
Perryâ€™s
halftime
show
during
Super
Bowl
XLIX,
as
they
returned
to
work
at
ESPN
studios
in
Bristol,
Connecticut.
Itâ€™s
a
funny
commercial
for
the
time
being,
but
thereâ€™s
no
way
this
goes
down
as
one
of
the
classic
â€œThis
Is
SportsCenterâ€?
commercials,
as
everyone
will
forget
about
the
sharks
from
Katy
Perryâ€™s
halftime
show
in
a
week
if
they
havenâ€™t
already.
