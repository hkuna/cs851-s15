â€œIn
amending
the
rules,
the
public
will
know
exactly
what
the
FCC
is
voting
on
well
before
the
vote,â€?
Heller
said
in
press
release
announcing
the
bill
Tuesday.
â€œRight
now,
we
donâ€™t
even
know
what
major
decision
like
the
FCCâ€™s
net
neutrality
order
says.
How
is
that
an
example
of
solid
rulemaking?â€?
