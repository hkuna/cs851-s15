At
a
casting
call
for
the
movie
last
April,
the
filmâ€™s
director
F.
Gary
Gray
told
KCRW
this
movie
shows
an
important
time
in
American
history.
â€œItâ€™s
not
unlike
â€˜Social
Networkâ€™
or
â€˜American
Graffiti,â€™
where
you
take
a
place
and
time
in
America,
especially
as
it
relates
to
popular
culture,
and
you
see
the
shift,
and
they
were
right
there
and
created
part
of
the
pivot
that
America
took
in
entertainment.
We
went
from
Madonna,
Michael
Jackson
and
Prince
to
hip-hop,
and
this
is
the
time
that
marks
that
shift
in
that
era.â€?
