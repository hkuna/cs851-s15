But
we
hope
this
can
empower
you
in
your
health
decisions
by
helping
you
learn
more
about
common
conditions.
Weâ€™re
rolling
it
out
over
the
next
few
days,
in
the
U.S.
in
English
to
start.
In
the
long
run,
not
only
do
we
plan
to
cover
many
more
medical
conditions,
but
we
also
want
to
extend
this
to
other
parts
of
the
world.
So
the
next
time
you
need
info
on
frostbite
symptoms,
or
treatments
for
tennis
elbow,
or
the
basics
on
measles,
the
Google
app
will
be
a
better
place
to
start.
