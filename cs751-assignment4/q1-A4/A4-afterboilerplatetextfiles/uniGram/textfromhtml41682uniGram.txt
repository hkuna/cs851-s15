I
finally
got
a
copy
of
the
book
by
Zoe
Ambler
and
I
am
looking
forward
to
the
next
one.
I
admit
I
found
the
premise
of
our
impending
Vampire/Zombie
apocalypse
world
a
little
daunting
but
Zoe
to
effort
to
immerse
the
reader
into
this
world
with
some
details
that
well
I
had
to
walk
away
from.
Granted
I
do
go
thru
life
with
rose
colored
glasses
but
if
I
took
them
off
would
I
see
the
zombies
and
vampires
better?I
wonder
if
we
really
do
go
thru
life
with
this
much
loss
and
triumphs,
and
I
wonder
if
this
isn't
the
stage
for
a
great
Role
Playing
Game
(RPG)
that
would
make
this
a
great
narrative
although
still
elements
of
violence
while
probably
realistic
in
an
apocalyptic
world
did
cause
me
to
"turn
the
page"
more
than
once
to
get
back
to
the
heroine
(?)
journey.
Supporting
characters
would
maybe
a
good
side
short
story
but
again
I
think
those
even
belong
in
the
RPG
world
because
their
demise
is
necessary
for
the
heroine.
I
only
put
a
question
mark
next
to
heroine
because
the
back
story
is
more
that
of
a
victim
instead
of
the
stronger
of
two
main
characters.
Finally,
I
still
find
myself
rather
looking
forward
to
the
next
story
because
I
want
to
see
our
heroine
grow.
