Harari
is
a
masterful
debunker,
dramatically
exposing
accepted
realities
to
be
nothing
more
than
imaginative
constructs.
In
Sapiens,
I
love
his
grandiose
leaps
("capitalism
is
a
religion"--
wow!
what
an
idea!)
but
I
have
to
say
some
of
his
facts
are
wrong
(e.g.
he
says
Neanderthal
genes
are
only
in
"modern
populations
in
the
Middle
East
and
Europe,"
when
in
truth
they
are
in
all
humans
except
Sub-Saharan
Africans),
and
sometimes
he
doesn't
leap
where
he
ought
(he
makes
a
case
for
women
being
lesser
creatures
because
he
doesn't
accord
them
the
same
strenuous
argument
he
applies
to
male
people
of
color).
A
fascinating
book,
overall.
