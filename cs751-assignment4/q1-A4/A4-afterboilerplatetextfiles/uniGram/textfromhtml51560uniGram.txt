In
order
to
release
weight,
you
must
intake
less
calories
than
the
calories
you
burn
in
a
day.
So
yes,
you
will
have
to
modify
your
food
and/or
increase
your
exercise.
Some
of
you
may
not
be
ready
for
exercise
yet
and
that's
okay,
you
can
build
up
to
it.
Exercise
is
an
excellent
source
of
burning
calories,
not
to
mention
numerous
other
benefits.
You
will
want
to
choose
a
combination
of
cardio
as
well
as
weights.
Choose
something
you
enjoy
-
bike
riding,
running,
walking,
surfing,
basketball,
skipping,
skiing
-
for
your
cardio
and
mix
it
up
as
often
as
you
can.
Your
body
adapts
to
what
you
are
doing
and
by
changing
it
up
regularly,
it
will
have
to
keep
working
different
muscles.
Weights
are
really
important
to
keep
your
muscle
mass
which
keeps
your
metabolism
elevated.
Please
don't
think
you're
going
to
bulk
up
if
you
do
weights
-
that's
another
program
altogether!
When
designing
your
weight
loss
journey
it
is
important
to
choose
whole
foods
as
opposed
to
refined
or
processed
foods.
The
easiest
way
to
remember
this
is
to
shop
on
the
outskirts
of
the
supermarket
-
fresh
is
best.
The
frequency
of
your
meals
and
snacks
is
also
important
to
keep
your
metabolism
working.
Ideally
3
meals
and
2
snacks
per
day
ensures
you
are
feeding
your
body
regularly.
I'm
loving
the
changes
in
my
body
and
health
and
hope
you
decide
that
now
is
the
time
to
make
a
difference.
