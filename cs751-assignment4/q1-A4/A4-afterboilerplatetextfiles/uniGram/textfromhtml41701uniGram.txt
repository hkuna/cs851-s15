the
termination
of
FutureGen,
there
are
a
handful
of
remaining
planned

a
coal
plant

they

plant
in
Mississippi.

year,
SaskPower's
Boundary
Dam
Power
Station
in
Canada
became

first
large
coal
plant
globally
to
capture
the
majority
of
its
emissions.
m
hopeful
that
Illinois
will
continue
to
play
an
integral
role
in
developing
this
technology,"
