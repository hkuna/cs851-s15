Despite
the
new
amendment,
a
rare
chunk
of
the
Pine
Rocklands
is
still
slated
for
demolition
and
our
climate
change-denying,
anti-environmentalgovernor
refuses
to
take
a
solid
stance
on
the
environment.
When
will
our
elected
officials
step
in
and
do
what
is
best
for
their
state?
Probably
when
you
tell
them
that
money
grows
on
trees.
After
all;
money,
power,
and
glory
seem
to
be
the
only
motivating
factor
in
our
current
political
landscape.
ns
of
dollars
will
go
to
keeping
Florida's
water
clean,
protecting
the
plethora
of
bodies
of
water,
restoring
the
wetlands,
forests
and
beaches
and
protecting
national
treasures
such
as
the
Everglades
National
Park.
Guess
who
was
against
it?
The
Florida
Chamber
of
Commerce
and
*drum
roll
please*
Governor
Rick
Scott,
who
refused
to
publicly
take
a
position.
Shocker.
