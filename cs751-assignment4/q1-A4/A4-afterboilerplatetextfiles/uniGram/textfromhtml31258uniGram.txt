Hello.
My
name
is
Charlene
Iverson.
I
was
born
and
raised
in
the
small
town
of
Mandan,
North
Dakota.
I
have
always
been
interested
in
the
world
of
the
supernatural.
I
don't
look
for
ghosts.
They
find
me.
I
love
animals
and
have
rescued
many
and
found
homes
for
them.
When
not
writing
and
taking
care
of
my
family
and
pets,
I
work
with
people
with
developmental
disabilities.
I
am
also
an
artist,
specializing
in
landscapes
and
abstract
art.
During
my
High
School
and
College
years
I
took
as
many
writing
and
English
classes
as
I
possibly
could
find.
I
also
searched
on
line
and
took
some
poetry
and
novel
writing
classes.
I
am
married
to
a
wonderful
man,
Howard.
And
I
have
two
daughters,
five
grandchildren
and
two
great
grandchildren.
I
have
been
writing
since
I
was
a
teenager
and
love
to
write
about
just
about
anything.
I
write
about
ghosts,
end
time
prophecies,
people
with
disabilities
and
things
I
see
on
the
news.
I
find
a
book
in
everything
that
I
do.
I
love
poetry
and
have
also
published
a
book
of
poetry.
I
hope
you
enjoy
my
work.
Happy
Reading!
