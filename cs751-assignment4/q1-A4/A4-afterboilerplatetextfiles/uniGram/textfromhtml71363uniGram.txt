Some
cardiology
experts
disagree
with
this
approach
because
statins
offer
minimal
benefits
to
those
at
low
heart
disease
risk
â€”
often
at
the
cost
of
side
effects
like
muscle
aches
which
make
it
harder
to
exercise.
â€œWhile
some
young
individuals
with
a
strong
family
history
will
have
cholesterol
levels
high
enough
to
justify
treatment,
the
real
message
here
is
the
importance
of
diet,
exercise,
and
smoking
cessation
early
in
life,â€?
said
Dr.
Paul
Ridker,
director
of
the
center
for
cardiovascular
disease
prevention
at
Brigham
and
Womenâ€™s
Hospital.
