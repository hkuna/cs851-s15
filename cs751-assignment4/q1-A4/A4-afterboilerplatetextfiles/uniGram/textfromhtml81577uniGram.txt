If
â€œBetter
Call
Saulâ€?
takes
that
road,
the
show
might
owe
something
to
â€œThe
Wireâ€?
as
well
as
â€œBreaking
Bad.â€?
Granted,
this
series
does
not
have
the
sociological
ambitions
and
reportorial
background
of
David
Simonâ€™s
five-season
study
of
struggling
Baltimore.
But,
on
a
more
modest
scale,
and
working
in
a
different
register,
â€œBetter
Call
Saulâ€?
may
reflect
that
showâ€™s
influence.
Jimmy,
in
a
meeting
with
Nacho
at
the
end
of
episode
two,
tries
to
assure
the
drug
dealer
that
he
does
not
plan
to
pursue
his
own
criminal
enterprises.
â€œIâ€™m
not
in
the
game,â€?
he
says.
â€œI
promise.â€?
But
the
lesson
of
â€œThe
Wire,â€?
memorably
shared
in
a
great
courthouse
scene
featuring
a
lawyer
even
shadier
than
Jimmy,
is
that
itâ€™s
all
in
the
game.
Maybe
Jimmy
will
learn
that,
too,
before
he
starts
to
play.
nwhile,
public
defenders
are
left
haggling
with
parking
lot
attendants
over
a
couple
of
dollars
and
the
correct
number
of
validation
stickers.
Perhaps
all
these
unfairnesses
are
not
unrelated.
Perhaps
Jimmy,
before
he
decides
to
make
a
living
off
this
corrupt
system,
could
figure
something
out
about
how
it
fits
together.
