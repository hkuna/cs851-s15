Keep
your
bike
out
where
you
can
see
it.
No,
you
don’t
have
to
use
it…
Just
put
it
out
there,
in
front
of
you,
where
you
can
eyeball
it.
Every
day,
when
you
run
to
the
car
and
hop
in.
Wait,
you
don’t
have
a
bike?
Hmmm.
Maybe
call
up
a
neighbor
and
see
if
you
can
borrow
one.

Help
out
your
neighbors.
Donate
to
a
charity.
Buy
that
homeless
guy
a
meal.
We
are
all
part
of
the
same
human
family.
