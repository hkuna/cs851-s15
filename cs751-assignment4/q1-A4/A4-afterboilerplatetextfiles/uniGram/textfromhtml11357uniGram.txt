Good,
I
am
glad.
He
could
have
been
responsible
for
somebody
being
shot...
imagine
if
there
was
a
baby
in
one
of
those
houses
and
the
police
threw
in
a
flash
bang
or
something.
I
don't
wish
death
on
this
guy,
or
even
sexual
assault
(which
is
a
pretty
disgusting
thing
to
wish
on
any
human
being),
but
I
do
wish
for
him
to
be
miserable
for
the
next
5
years
of
his
life.
Sitting
and
crying
wishing
he
would
have
never
resorted
to
such
childish
BS,
he
will
truly
know
the
feeling
of
helplessness.
