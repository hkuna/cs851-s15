I
love
the
game,
but
I've
considered
deleting
it
altogether
because
it
doesn't
seem
like
I
can
get
ahead
without
spending
an
absurd
amount
of
money.
It
doesn't
seem
worth
it.
I
hope
some
things
get
changed
so
more
people
(other
struggling
people
who
just
want
to
join
in
on
the
fun)
like
me,
can
enjoy
the
game
too.
.
I
feel
like
I
can't
get
half
the
items
because
I
never
have
enough
K
stars.
And
even
when
I
do
have
some,
it's
never
enough
because
all
the
items
cost
a
ridiculous
amount
of
game
money
or
K
stars.

Give
us
more
opportunities
to
earn
K
stars
within
the
game,
besides
just
watching
video
after
video....after
video.
If
everything
is
going
to
cost
a
ton
of
those
stars,
you
might
as
well
give
us
a
way
to
get
them
without
spending
an
absurd
amount
of
real,
hard-earned
money.
Not
everybody
who
plays
this
game
is
as
rich
as
KimK!(4)
I
have
used
real
money
in
apps
before,
but
I
won't
in
this
game
because
it's
so
expensive.
5
dollars
for
only
a
small
amount
of
stars,
that
couldn't
even
buy
a
pair
of
earrings
in
the
game,
is
bogus.
