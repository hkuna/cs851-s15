When
Princess
Leia
Organa
was
captured
by
the
Empire
as
a
Rebel
spy,
she
never
betrayed
her
convictions,
even
in
the
face
of
the
complete
destruction
of
her
home
world,
Alderaan.
When
her
rescue
came,
she
grabbed
a
blaster
and
joined
the
fight,
escaping
back
to
the
Rebel
Alliance
and
helping
strike
the
biggest
blow
against
the
Empire-the
destruction
of
the
Death
Star.
But
in
the
aftermath
of
that
victory,
the
question
remains...what
is
a
princess
without
a
world?
