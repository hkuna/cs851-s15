Mazda
is
also
going
to
use
the
Chicago
show
to
introduce
its
Heritage
Collection,
which
encompasses
three
clothing
lines
said
to
be
inspired
by
Mazdaâ€™s
past,
present,
and
future.
If
â€œPastâ€?
means
weâ€™ll
be
leaving
Chicago
wearing
clothing
emblazoned
with
graphic
images
of
vintage
rotary
engine
schematics
and
Mazda
R360
sedans
culled
from
the
corporate
archives,
we
canâ€™t
wait.
Weâ€™ll
leave
the
â€œPresentâ€?
and
â€œFutureâ€?
lines
for
those
more
afflicted
with
the
Miata
disorder.
