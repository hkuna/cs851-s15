Our
biggest
challenge,
then,
will
be
to
help
our
teacher
leaders
reach
a
broader
teaching
community
so
they
can
share
their
activities
and
create
widespread
changes
in
curriculum
design
and
practice.
We
plan
to
achieve
scale
by
using
the
projectâ€™s
network
hub
and
group
features
on
OER
Commons,
as
well
as
through
social
media,
especially
Twitter
and
blog
posts,
where
our
teacher
leaders
can
reach
out
beyond
their
own
local
contacts.
Given
these
objectives,
our
work
will
surpass
mere
implementation
of
the
new
Common
Core
standards
in
each
classroom,
and
also
build
leaders
who
are
learning
to
be
flexible
and
vocal,
rather
than
standing
as
isolated
obstacles
to
change.
