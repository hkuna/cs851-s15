Coming
off
the
success
of
his
last
â€œHigh
Gradeâ€?
video,
Twisted
minds
Records
artiste
P.R.E,
kicks
off
the
new
year
with
â€œThis
Girlâ€œ.
The
song,
a
highly
dance-able
Shizzi-produced
track
with
a
reggae
feel
to
it,
is
accompanied
by
the
Sesan-directed
video
that
is
nothing
short
of
class.
Shot
on
different
sets
in
SA,
the
flick
is
characterized
by
a
set
of
models
flirting
with
the
singer.
Check
it
out.
