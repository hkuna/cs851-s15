The
Nike
KD7
has
seen
its
fair
share
of
refashioning,
but
no
other
models
warrant
the
same
sentiment
to
Kevin
Durant
as
the
KD7
â€œAunt
Pearl.â€?
As
a
eulogy
to
his
late
aunt
who
succumbed
to
lung
cancer
in
2001,
Durant
had
an
angel
depiction
placed
on
his
back
in
the
form
of
a
tattoo.
Nike
designer
Leo
Chang
articulated
Durantâ€™s
memory
of
Aunt
Pearl
by
creating
a
customized
sneaker
based
on
Durantâ€™s
tributary
artwork.
A
three-dimensional
wing
strap,
inscribed
with
a
touching
acknowledgment
to
his
aunt
and
an
endorsement
of
the
Kay
Yow
Cancer
Fund
for
whom
Nike
has
been
a
supporter
of
for
seven
years,
graces
the
front
of
the
shoe
while
an
imprint
of
Durantâ€™s
tattoo
is
embedded
on
the
inside
of
the
tongue.
The
KD7
â€œAunt
Pearlâ€?
shoe
will
be
available
beginning
February
19
at
Nike.com
and
select
retail
locations
globally.
