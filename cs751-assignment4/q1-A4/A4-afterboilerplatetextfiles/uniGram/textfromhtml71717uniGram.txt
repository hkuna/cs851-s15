Because
of
incorrect
information
provided
by
Mr.
Cole,
this
article
originally
misstated
the
University
of
Mississippiâ€™s
decision
on
its
Confederate
Statue
and
Vardaman
Hall.
The
university
is
not
in
the
process
of
deciding
what
to
do;
it
has
already
decided
to
install
explanatory
plaques
alongside
the
structures.
The
article
has
been
updated
to
reflect
this
correction.
