Speaking
in
2013,
Martin
Knowles,
West
Midlands
Police
Deputy
Air
Operations
Manager,
said:
'Our
thermal
cameras
can
detect
unusually
high
temperatures
coming
from
properties
several
thousand
feet
away
â€“
anyone
growing
cannabis
on
a
commercial
scale,
using
rows
of
heat
lamps,
runs
the
very
real
risk
their
criminality
will
be
rumbled
from
the
skies.'
