I
think
that
when
historians
look
back
at
the
post-war
Commonwealth
immigration
they
will
note
of
course
the
ethnic
transformation
that
some
like
Enoch
Powell
correctly
foresaw
but
wrongfully
and
dangerously
diagnosed
as
leading
to
‘a
race
war’;
but
they
will
also
note
the
religious
transformation
of
this
country
that
no
one
at
the
time
foresaw.
These
two
transformations
are
working
their
effects
across
so
many
features
of
social,
economic
and
political
life
but
one
which
I
think
we
have
been
slow
to
recognise
is
what
it
means
in
terms
of
the
place
of
religion
and
belief
in
British
public
life.
Unfortunately,
for
too
many
politicians
and
others
this
question
is
too
dominated
by
issues
of
extremism,
violence
and
terrorism.
Such
phenomena
are
exceptional
and
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
judge
religion,
not
to
mention
Muslims
and
Islam,
in
such
fearful
terms.
We
need
to
think
of
not
just
the
harm
that
some
militants
can
do
but
about
the
good
that
religion
has
to
offer,
not
just
to
individuals
but
to
communities
and
society
as
a
whole;
not
just
about
religious
minorities
as
fringe
movements
but
about
their
place
in
the
mainstream.
