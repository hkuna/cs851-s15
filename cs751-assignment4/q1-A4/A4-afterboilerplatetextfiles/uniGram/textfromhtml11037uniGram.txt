â€œâ€˜Letâ€™s
Move!â€™
is
completely
in
accord
with
what
my
husbandâ€™s
goals
are
for
improving
the
overall
health
of
our
country
and
saving
us
as
a
nation
billions
of
dollars
every
single
year,â€?

said.
â€œAll
these
initiatives
are
going
to
save
us
money.
Theyâ€™re
going
to
make
us
feel
better.
Theyâ€™re
going
to
put
us
in
a
position
to
be
more
productive
as
a
society.â€?
