Lastly,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
achieving,
as
long
as
one
does
not
forget
to
find
one's
purpose
and
make
a
commitment
for
it.
There
should
be
a
balance
between
the
two.
Better
if
we
make
our
life
goals
towards
our
personal
achievements
in
line
or
parallel
with
our
purpose
in
life.
In
this
way,
we
do
something
for
ourselves
and
for
others
using
the
same
effort
and
direction
in
life.
for
others
is
the
single
most
important
factor
for
one
to
realize
his
or
her
purpose
in
life.
