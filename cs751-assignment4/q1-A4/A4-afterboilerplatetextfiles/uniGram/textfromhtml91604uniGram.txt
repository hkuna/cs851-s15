No
one
got
under
Barack’s
skin
more
than
[New
York
Times
columnist]
Maureen
[Dowd]
...
Her
penchant
for
delving
into
the
psyches
of
her
subjects
was
particularly
irritating
to
the
self-possessed
Obama.
...
Normally
polite
under
any
circumstances,
he
was
patronizing
and
disrespectful
to
Maureen
in
a
way
I
had
rarely
seen.
This
was
not
well
received
by
Dowd
who,
like
most
journalists,
was
accustomed
to
firing
off
salvos,
yet
decidedly
uncomfortable
when
fired
upon
herself.
After
that
awkward
encounter,
she
seemed
to
take
particular
delight
in
psychoanalyzing
Barack
and
belittling
him
in
print,
which
only
deepened
his
contempt.
Maureen,
who
is
as
gracious
and
loyal
to
her
friends
as
she
is
rough
on
the
high
and
mighty,
would
become
a
friend
of
mine
in
Washington,
which
became
a
minor
source
of
tension
with
Obama.
‘Why
are
you
friends
with
her?’
he
would
demand
after
Maureen
sent
one
of
her
acid
darts
his
way.
