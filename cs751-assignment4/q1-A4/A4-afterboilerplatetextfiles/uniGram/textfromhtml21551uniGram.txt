This
being
Israel,
everything
could
change
between
now
and
March
17.
Labour
only
has
to
edge
a
single
seat
ahead
of
Likud
for
Netanyahu
to
be
finished.
But
right
now
his
opponents
look
like
a
team
facing
an
open
goal
and
poised
to
miss.
They
need
to
raise
their
game
–
and
fast.
Otherwise
he
will
renew
the
lease
on
an
office
he
has
come
to
regard
as
his
own.
Of
course
a
change
at
the
top
will
arrive
eventually
–
but
Israel
itself
might
have
to
change
first.
ver
irrational
that
may
seem
to
people
far
away
–
might
well
conclude
that
it’s
safer
with
Bibi
than
with
the
untested
freier-in-waiting
they
detect
in
Herzog.
