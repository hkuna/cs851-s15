As
a
current
board
member
of
the
Historic
Pullman
Foundation,
it
is
surprising
to
see
the
news
today.
It
is
even
more
surprising
that
President
Obama
is
coming
days
before
the
mayoral
election
to
make
this
announcement.
Hopefully
the
Mayor
and
the
President
will
both
highlight
and
credit
the
five
decade
grassroots
effort
that
led
to
this,
because
right
now
it
just
looks
like
politics.
