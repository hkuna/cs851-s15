"We
support
the
candlelight
vigil
for
Bobbi
Kristina.
The
Brown
family
is
amazed
by
the
love
and
support
from
all
that
attended."
Said
Christopher
Brown
of
Brown
&
Rosen
LLC,
legal
counsel
for
Bobby
Brown.
"However
the
false
reports
that
continue
to
appear
in
print
and
on
the
internet
are
egregious,
false
and
will
be
dealt
with
at
an
appropriate
time.
In
particular,
the
false
reporting
of
TMZ,
The
National
Enquirer,
The
Atlanta
Journal
Constitution
and
the
Daily
Mail
(UK)
citing,
police
sources,
family
sources
and
Bobby
Brown
himself,
will
receive
my
attention.
The
desire
to
be
"first"
has
clouded
the
judgment
of
many
reporters
as
they
forgo
accuracy.
This
is
a
criminal
investigation
and
the
integrity
of
that
process
requires
silence."
Brown
added.
