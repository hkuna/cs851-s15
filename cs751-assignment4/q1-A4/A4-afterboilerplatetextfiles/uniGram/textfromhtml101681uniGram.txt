In
order
to
see
truly
major
results,
Fryben
suggests
doing
10
to
20
consecutive
treatments
as
close
together
as
possible
(preferably
every
day),
taking
a
break
for
about
two
months,
and
repeating.
"Since
you
can't
stay
in
the
machine
for
more
than
three
minutes,
you
need
to
do
it
more
often
in
order
for
the
inflammation
to
be
decreased,"
explains
Fryben.
But
at
$90
a
session,
it
looks
like
I
would
need
to
freeze
my
spending
habits
and
really
throw
all
my
earnings
at
cryotherapy
before
I
can
have
legs
like
Gisele
Bündchen.
e.
That
blood
is
being
nourished
with
enzymes
and
oxygen,
and
it
is
being
delivered
to
every
single
cell
in
your
body
so
you
can
perform
at
the
highest
level."
That
explains
the
glow.
As
for
my
thinner
thighs,
cryotherapy
is
known
to
curb
cortisol
levels—the
hormone
responsible
for
water
retention.
Fast
and
effective:
no
wonder
models
like
Crystal
Renn
and
Maryna
Linchuk
turn
to
cryotherapy.
(Dudes
seem
to
like
it
too,
with
Daniel
Craig
reportedly
using
cryotherapy
to
get
in
shape
for
Skyfall.)
