Iâ€™ve
been
tweeting
with
the
hashtag
#28DaysAreNotEnough.
We
should
be
talking
about
these
things
outside
of
Black
History
Month.
If
anyone
wants
to
post
any
stories
about
Black
History,
post
them
with
the
hashtag
#28DaysAreNotEnough.
Jackie
Robinson
â€”
sort
of
the
â€˜Greatest
Hitsâ€™
of
Black
History
â€”
you
donâ€™t
have
time
for
the
other
stories.
Then
we
go
back
to
â€œregular
history.â€?
When
in
reality,
African-American
history
is
American
history,
and
we
need
to
incorporate
the
American
mythos
and
the
idea
of
Black
History
into
every
day
history
in
a
more
intertwined
way.
