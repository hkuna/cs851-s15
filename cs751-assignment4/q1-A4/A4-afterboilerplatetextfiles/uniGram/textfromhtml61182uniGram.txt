As
if
we
needed
a
reminder
of
our
distance
from
the
Mars
rovers,
this
overhead
view
shows
the
Curiosity
rover
(center)
as
a
tiny
gray-blue
square
in
a
sea
of
sand.
Taken
by
a
camera
on
NASAâ€™s
Mars
Reconnaissance
Orbiter,
the
image
shows
Curiosity
parked
near
the
Pahrump
Hills
at
the
base
of
Mount
Sharp.
