So
when
the
astronomically
high
box
office
numbers
for
â€œFifty
Shades
of
Greyâ€?
roll
in
this
Friday,
donâ€™t
expect
me
to
be
surprised.
There
is
a
clear
thirst
for
diverse
depictions
of
female
experience
on
screen,
one
that
isnâ€™t
being
met
by
the
paltry
offerings
Hollywood
is
putting
forward.
(And
isnâ€™t
necessarily
being
sated
by
TVâ€™s
diverse
landscape
of
rich
female
roles,
either.)
The
numbers
donâ€™t
lie:
Jennifer
Lopezâ€™s
â€œBoy
Next
Doorâ€?
was
by
all
accounts
not
a
good
movie,
but
viewers
showed
up
in
droves,
with
the
film
ultimately
grossing
over
eight
times
its
original
budget.
Anastasia
Steele
may
not
exactly
be
a
feminist
hero,
but
sheâ€™s
a
real
woman
with
a
set
of
unique
goals
and
desires,
whose
billing
isnâ€™t
â€œwifeâ€?
or
â€œsexy
co-ed
number
2â€³
or
â€œKatniss
Everdeen.â€?
Her
story
matters.
We
might
be
a
long
way
from
seeing
femininity
represented
all
its
myriad
hues
and
shades,
but
at
least
â€œFifty
Shadesâ€?
is
a
start.
