Damned
interesting
animals,
for
sure.
But
we
donâ€™t
have
a
monopoly
on
that.
Letâ€™s
not
squander
that
opportunity
by
getting
caught
up
in
arguments
over
whether
Tommy
the
chimpanzee,
our
pet
dogs,
or
any
other
species
should
be
seen
as
people,
and
instead
adopt
the
mantra:
â€œPeople
are
animals,
too.â€?
