Ramsey’s
first
album
is
magical.
I
can’t
wait
to
see
what
he’s
come
up
with
for
his
second
one,
already
titled
Gentilly.
Ramsey
is
using
topnotch
backing
musicians,
including
harmonica
great
Mickey
Raphael
of
Willie
Nelson’s
band.
The
songs
are
surely
going
to
be
something
special.
Will
it
top
his
first
album?
Based
on
some
of
the
songs
he’s
played
at
concerts
that
are
pegged
for
the
second
album,
I
predict
it’ll
be
every
bit
as
good.
Maybe
better.
