Wanna
keep
a
Spidey
actor,
keep
Tobey,
yeah
3
sucked
bad
apart
from
Sandman
but
was
much
better
than
AM2
was,
that
was
a
complete
nightmare.
Course
they
going
to
cast
new
so
either
ain't
gonna
happen,
like
I
said,
hoping
they
cast
J.K.
Simmons
as
JJJ,
no
one
can
replace
him,
was
just
so
damn
good
as
the
character!
