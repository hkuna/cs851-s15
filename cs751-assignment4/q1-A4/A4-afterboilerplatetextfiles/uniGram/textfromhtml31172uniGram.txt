Good
evening
from
the
kid.
If
you
are
ever
in
the
area
and
need
some
seafood,
Big
Daddys
Seafood
&
Rib
Ranch
located
in
South
Jersey,Williamstown,
to
be
exact.
This
new
crab
shack
is
family
owned,
I
mean
the
husband,
wife,
sons
and
niece!!
I
will
tell
you
one
thing,
this
family
does
their
DAMN
THANG!!!
The
fish,
both
Whiting
and
Catfish,
are
on
point.
The
crabs
are
juicy
and
full
of
Big
Daddys
Seafood
and
Rib
Ranch
secret
spices.
Prices
are
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
food
that
they
give
and
service
is
great.
Mitch
is
usually
upfront
and
will
be
the
first
one
you
see
when
you
pull
up.
Just
expect
a
conversation
while
you
eat
(which
is
not
a
bad
thing).
The
service
reminds
me
of
the
old
time
restaurants.
It
reminds
me
of
a
time
when
everyone
spoke
to
each
other
and
an
eatery
was
a
place
of
great
conversation
and
people
just
having
fun.
At
Big
Daddys,
you
have
the
option
of
sitting
at
the
â€œbarâ€?,
in
your
car
or
taking
your
order
to
go.
I
have
not
tried
the
whole
menu
yet
but
I
promise
you,
as
I
try
different
things,
I
will
post
about
it.
Expect
to
hear
a
lot
of
thing
about
this
great
family
owned
seafood
shack.
My
family
and
I
will
be
back
and
back
and
back
again.
So
again,
if
you
are
in
the
area,
please
stop
by.
You
can
also
find
them
on
Facebook,
Twitter,
Instagram
and
Youtube.
Just
search
Big
Daddys
Seafood
and
Rib
Ranch.
