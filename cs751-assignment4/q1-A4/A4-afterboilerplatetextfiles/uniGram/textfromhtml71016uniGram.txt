Alexanderâ€™s
writing
style
is
clear
and
crisp.
His
characters
are
finely-drawn
and
complex
enough
to
keep
the
readerâ€™s
attention.
I
loved
the
mystery
and
dis-illuminate
story
lines,
which
criss-crossed
and
finally
converged
in
a
disturbing
ending.
â€œVisions
of
a
Rejectâ€?
might
feed
your
fears
that
the
world
isnâ€™t
really
getting
better,
and
it
might
persuade
you
to
finally
escape
from
your
sad
white
cubicle.
Or
it
might
simply
tell
you
what
you
already
knew,
deep
down.
That
the
world
as
we
know
it,
isnâ€™t
really
as
we
know
it.
