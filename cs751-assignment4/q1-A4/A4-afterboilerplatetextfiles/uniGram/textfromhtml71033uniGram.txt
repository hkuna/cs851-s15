Stephen
Williams,
the
minister
for
communities,
said
the
government
â€œactively
supportsâ€?
allotments.
â€œWhere
we
have
consented
to
the
disposal
of
allotments,
alternative
plots
have
been
provided.
Surveys
too
by
the
National
Allotment
Society
show
that
over
2,000
new
allotment
places
have
been
created
in
last
few
years,
and
allotment
waiting
times
have
fallen.â€?
