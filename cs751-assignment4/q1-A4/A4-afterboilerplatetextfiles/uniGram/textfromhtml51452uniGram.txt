One
type
of
Phishing
(fake
emails
to
trick
you
into
sharing
your
private
financial
details)
is
to
send
a
note
claiming
to
want
to
send
you
a
sum
of
money
but
not
being
able
to
because
they
have
been
told
you
are
deceased.
The
idea
is
for
you
to
prove
you
are
not
dead
by
giving
up
your
financial
information.
As
always,
if
it
sounds
too
good
to
be
true,
it
is
probably
not
true.
If
someone
wants
to
contact
you
in
order
to
give
you
a
large
sum
of
money,
they
will
almost
certainly
do
it
by
certified
mail,
not
by
email.
