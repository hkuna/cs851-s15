Background
It
belongs
to
the
Indo-European
family,
Slavonic
group,
East
Slavonic
subgroup
and
is
spoken
by
over
290
million
people,
including
second
language
users,
in
all
countries.
Russian
was
the
lingua
franca
of
the
Russian
Empire
and
the
Union
of
Soviet
Socialist
Republics
(USSR);
it
is
still
used
as
a
second
language
in
the
newly
independent
states
of
the
former
Soviet
Union.
Russian
includes
three
groups
of
dialects:
northern,
southern,
and
central.
Literary
Russian
is
essentially
based
on
the
central
dialect
of
Moscow.
The
Russian
language
uses
the
Cyrillic
alphabet,
which
originated
from
the
first
translation
of
the
Christian
Bible
into
a
Slavic
language
(Paleoslav,
or
ancient
Bulgarian,
spoken
in
what
is
modern
Macedonia,
from
which
all
Slavic
languages
descended),
by
Saint
Methodius
and
Saint
Cyril
of
Constantinople,
in
the
9th
century.
Subsequent
to
the
1918
reform
of
Russian
orthography,
certain
letters
of
the
alphabet
were
suppressed
and
spelling
rules
simplified.
In
Russian
grammar
verbs
generally
have
two
aspects,
each
represented
by
a
separate
infinitive:
the
"imperfective"
to
indicate
a
continuing
action,
and
the
"perfective"
to
indicate
an
action
already
completed
or
to
be
completed.
The
stress
in
Russian
is
also
particularly
difficult,
impossible
to
predict
in
an
unfamiliar
word,
and
frequently
shifting
in
the
course
of
declensions
or
conjugations.
