Many candidates run into situations where they are made counter offers in an attempt to deter them from taking that next step in their career. My extensive experience in the IT staffing industry has shown me that accepting a counter offer is a bad decision for you and your career. There are many reasons why people want to find new jobs but not many to stay at your old one if you are unhappy there. Accepting a counter offer provides nothing but a short term solution that will only become a problem again. @JavaKatlyn
