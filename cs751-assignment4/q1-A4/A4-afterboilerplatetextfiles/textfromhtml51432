I'm a wife, nanny to twins, and puggle momma. I love anything Jane Austin, obsessed with the holidays and Michael Buble. I love fall and anything having to do with fall. I'm a love of life & a believer and I love the Lord with all my heart. Lastly if I've not had my caffeine, look out! Welcome to the craziness ;)
