If I could give it no stars I would. I am a young cow calf guy thinking I will spend $19.99 and make my life a lot easier. But it's very confusing and the record keeping makes no sense. Buy a notebook and a pen you will be farther ahead. If hitler, bin laden, and this app were in a room and I had a gun with 2 bullets I shoot this app twice.
