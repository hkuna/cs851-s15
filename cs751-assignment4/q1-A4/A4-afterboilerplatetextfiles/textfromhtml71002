Returning to the National Football Museum on Sunday 15 February, the campaign will be delivering a Fans v Homophobia conference, bringing together 120 delegates representing supporters groups, campaigning organisations and individual fans to discuss issues of LGBT discrimination.
: “We’ve had a fantastic year working across football, but we know that homophobic attitudes and behaviours begin at an early age. We have also launched a new leaflet for junior players, which challenges homophobic language and stereotypes and asks children to join with us to ensure football really is for everyone”.
