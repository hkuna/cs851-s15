A recent publication describes the painstaking formative research involving 123 adults with SCD associated with the development of ASCQ-Me:
 develop an SCD health related quality of life measurement system that would help to bridge the gaps in understanding about adult SCD patientsâ€™ experiences and long-term needs. Development of the Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System (ASCQ-Me) was the result of this collaboration. This instrument was designed to meet a number of information needs related to this population, including improving healthcare and informing health policy development.
