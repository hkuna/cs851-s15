A few other notes from Monday night: Fox’s Gotham (5.6 million, 1.8 in the demo) slipped this week as it hurriedly assured its introducing the Joker soon. Sleepy Hollow (3.9 million, 1.2) continued to struggle. ABC’s Bachelor (8.6 million, 2.7) rose and ranked as the night’s top-rated show. NBC’s State of Affairs (4 million, 1.0) didn’t help its renewal odds.
