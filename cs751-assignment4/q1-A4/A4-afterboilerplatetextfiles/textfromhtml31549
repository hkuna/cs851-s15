Tony Barber (2/9/2015 at 10:53 AM) We need to seriously question our continued financial investment in critical access hospitals. The current guidelines are too generous and lead to waste of resources that cannot be justified. These facilities should, in many cases, be replaced with a new model...using today's technology that scales the resources of non-critical access facilities to meet needs of those communities in a more cost-effective manner. We can't continue to "Prop up" the old [INVALID]em and that is exactly what this critical access program does.
