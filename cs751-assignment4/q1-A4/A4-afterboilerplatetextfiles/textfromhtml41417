“Don’t Kill the Fun” features Chris Brown, who harmonizes quite nicely with Streeter. In fact, they go together so well that Brown directed the video for “Don’t Kill the Fun,” which sends both Brown and Streeter into an old-school dance battle on a graffiti-soaked rooftop. Streeter gets to show off some slick moves, and between her dancing and her super-cool coo, it’s no wonder she cites the late Aaliyah as a major influence.
