The Nike KD7 has seen its fair share of refashioning, but no other models warrant the same sentiment to Kevin Durant as the KD7 “Aunt Pearl.” As a eulogy to his late aunt who succumbed to lung cancer in 2001, Durant had an angel depiction placed on his back in the form of a tattoo. Nike designer Leo Chang articulated Durant’s memory of Aunt Pearl by creating a customized sneaker based on Durant’s tributary artwork. A three-dimensional wing strap, inscribed with a touching acknowledgment to his aunt and an endorsement of the Kay Yow Cancer Fund for whom Nike has been a supporter of for seven years, graces the front of the shoe while an imprint of Durant’s tattoo is embedded on the inside of the tongue. The KD7 “Aunt Pearl” shoe will be available beginning February 19 at Nike.com and select retail locations globally.
