You should *absolutely* take a mental health day! Whether you’re supposed to be at work, school, or another kind of obligatory commitment, you totally deserve to have a whole day to yourself and do whatever it is you wish. Spend it at the movies, spend it reading your favorite book, or you could even spend hanging out in bed all day. Everyone needs time to themselves every once in a while — it’s important to take care of yourself, clear your mind, and recharge your batteries. TREAT YOURSELF and enjoy the day :)
