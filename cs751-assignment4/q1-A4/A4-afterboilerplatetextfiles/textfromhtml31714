Most parts of the state still havenâ€™t approached their pre-recession prices, the Warren Group said. In Athol, the median home sold for $115,000, 39 percent lower than the pre-recessionary median of $180,000. Other central Massachusetts cities and towns, including Gardner and Fitchburg, are also a long way from seeing their housing prices recover.
