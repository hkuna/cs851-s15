This is marketing at its best! Some clubs are turning to “foot golf”, which has nothing to do with golf and this club is introducing pugilism. ‘Foot’ golf got a little publicity but pugilism has made the press right across America and all over the world. It’s novel, it’s bold and it’s effective! Anyone in the area of this club who has a fondness for dress standards that are disappearing elsewhere will flock along to join. They know that when there is a problem patrolman Joseph Kozowyk will soon be on the scene. “Any publicity is good publicity as long as they spell your name right”
