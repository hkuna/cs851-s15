Loose Cannon, who is previously signed to both Ruff Ryders and DMX’s Bloodline Records, enlists the D-Block general for an energetic street single that encourages the pursuit of victory. Van Savage, a singer signed to Loose Cannon’s 6ix5ive Records, provides a catchy hook that could propel him to be the next street corner crooner. The production on “See Me” is provided by Vacant Lot head honcho Dame Grease, which continues the producer’s string of top-notch work that has included producing for the likes of The LOX, DMX, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, and many more.
