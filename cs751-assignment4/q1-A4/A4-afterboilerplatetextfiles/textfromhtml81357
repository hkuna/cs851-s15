Saucer sleds are for kids. The Snolo Scion Sled is not. Made from fiber-reinforced high-density polyethylene, it's a serious piece of equipment, with a wide front ski that works on all kinds of snow, a low center of gravity, and a smart design that allows you to sit upright and steer, or lean into the corners like a motorcycle. Other features include Tetron seat padding covered in waterproof 600D nylon, four attachment points for accessories, and replaceable polished stainless steel allow runners.
