I love your photos! My July visit to Crater Lake totally surprised me with snow around the crater, it was gorgeous! I hadn’t realized at the time that boat cruises were possible, but it gives me good reason to go back. We loved canoeing and fishing in Sprague River, exploring Klamath and driving the Umpqua Scenic Byway – one of the prettiest drives in the country! This is my post about the trip: http://bit.ly/188QHE8 – Suzette, TrySomethingFun.com
