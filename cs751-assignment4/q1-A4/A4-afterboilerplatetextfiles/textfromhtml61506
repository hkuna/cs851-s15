This app does not allow you to display photos in “portrait” view. It only shows the photos in “landscape” view. This means if you want to use your iPad as a photo frame and dock it, it will display all your photos rotated 90 degrees. Sure, the app lets you individually edit every photo and rotate it relative to the landscape view, but this is hardly convenient when you want to quickly throw 100+ photos up on your iPad as a photo frame. This app is loaded with all sorts of useless features, but lacks basic functionality for “slideshows,” even though “slideshow” is in the app’s name! For this I paid $4. I haven’t hated an app this much in a long time. Avoid!!!
