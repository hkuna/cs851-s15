HELLO LADIES, IVE BEEN KNOWN AS A "WEAVOLOGIST" FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS, APPLYING REALISTIC SEWN IN WEAVES FOR WOMEN WHO WANT NATURAL HAIR EXTENTION. CLASSY & CHIC SEWN IN WEAVES LAST 1-3 MONTHS, AND NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW YOU HAVE A SEWN IN WEAVE. I HELP WOMEN THAT HAVE HAIR LOSS PROBLEMS, EDGES MISSING, AND RELAXED OR OVER PROCESSED HAIR. I ENJOY ENHANCING WOMENS NATURAL STYLE BY ADDING A LITTLE EXTRA "GLOW" ALL OF MY SEWN IN WEAVE PHOTOS SHOW WOMEN WHO HAVE EXTENTIONS BUT NO ONE CAN EVER TELL! MY PRICES ARE REASONABLE AND ARE ALWAYS VERY AFFORDABLE . I CAN ALSO APPLY THE WEAVES IN 30-45 MINUTES WITH NO HASSEL, NO LONG WAIT.
