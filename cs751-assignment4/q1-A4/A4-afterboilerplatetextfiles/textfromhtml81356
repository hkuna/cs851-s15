21 year old from Wales. I love my boyfriend who is my whole world (my heart is 10641 miles away), football, photography, music, reading and my dog. I suffer from depression and anxiety, and I'm recovering from self-harm. My ask box is always open, and I love interacting with my followers (I'm just not great at sending the first message). Some content may be of a sexual nature, but I reblog what I like. I always follow back, and love seeing new blogs. Please feel free to ask me anything! 186 days.
