To safeguard better the strategic long-term interests of The West in the war against Islamic terrorism, US politicians should keep a copy of “The Prince”, written by Niccolo Machiavelli, on their night tables. He had the following advice to those working in the spying profession:”If you need to injure someone, do it in such a way that you do not have to fear their vengeance.” Meaning, next time you interrogate an Islamic terrorist, while you are waging a war, don’t send him to Guantanamo. Finish the work by expediting his transition (with extreme prejudice) from this earthly journey to Allah’s heavenly kingdom, and let the jihadi discover if he is getting 72 virgins or a 72-year-old virgin. It is the only method that will minimize acts of vengeance and improve your chances of survival in the war.
