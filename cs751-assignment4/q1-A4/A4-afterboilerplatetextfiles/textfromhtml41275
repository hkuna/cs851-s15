In a questionable victory for blessed "freedom," a judge has ruled New York buses must run the uber-Zionist American Freedom Defense Initiative's vile new Islamophobic "Killing Jews" ads that brutally spoof a legit #MyJihad campaign to “take back Islam from Muslim and anti-Muslim extremists.” The court argued our much-touted if often problematic First Amendment protects even "offensive" material; more than one observer argued of the incendiary ads, "They may be legal, but they're disgusting."
