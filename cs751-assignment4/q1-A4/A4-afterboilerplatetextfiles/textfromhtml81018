A likely explanation for the relative lenience is China’s reliance on foreign technology. The country has been aggressively ramping up next generation mobile networks: shipments of 4G smartphones in China will hit 422 million by 2017, up from 152 million last year according to IDC. But more than 90 percent of chips are imported, which means even more reliance on foreign companies for expanding 4G networks. Beijing’s regulators may have a lot of weight, but Qualcomm is still very much in the game.
ese regulators will flex their interpretation of “good faith”, but there’s scope for Qualcomm to retain its dominance and market share.
