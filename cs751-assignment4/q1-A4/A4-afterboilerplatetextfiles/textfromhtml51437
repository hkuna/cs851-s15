If you need a good laugh, this book is for you. I am quoting some of Berty's remarks that had me double up with hysterical fits of laughter "Truth be told it was a long time since he'd seen anyone's mesmerising sight and he couldn't believe his luck...Woof, on all 4's waiting, tongue hanging out panting...high blood pressure does that in the middle-aged"
. What a great read to keep you laughing and cheering.
