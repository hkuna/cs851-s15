If “Better Call Saul” takes that road, the show might owe something to “The Wire” as well as “Breaking Bad.” Granted, this series does not have the sociological ambitions and reportorial background of David Simon’s five-season study of struggling Baltimore. But, on a more modest scale, and working in a different register, “Better Call Saul” may reflect that show’s influence. Jimmy, in a meeting with Nacho at the end of episode two, tries to assure the drug dealer that he does not plan to pursue his own criminal enterprises. “I’m not in the game,” he says. “I promise.” But the lesson of “The Wire,” memorably shared in a great courthouse scene featuring a lawyer even shadier than Jimmy, is that it’s all in the game. Maybe Jimmy will learn that, too, before he starts to play.
nwhile, public defenders are left haggling with parking lot attendants over a couple of dollars and the correct number of validation stickers. Perhaps all these unfairnesses are not unrelated. Perhaps Jimmy, before he decides to make a living off this corrupt system, could figure something out about how it fits together.
