Country music fans could not be happier because this is looking to be a big year for country music. Tim McGraw, one of today’s biggest country music stars, will appear at most of the 2015 Country Megaticket concert shows, but he’s announced his summer plans (aka Shotgun Rider Tour) to tour with Billy Currington and Chase Bryant. Beginning in June, Tim McGraw will be hitting the road on his own tour and brining along two other country favorites Billy Currington and Chase Bryant. The trio will be visiting states such as Massachusetts, Arizona, New Mexico, North Carolina, Connecticut, New Jersey, Virginia, Kansas, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Utah, California, plus others along with a handful of shows up in Canada too.
