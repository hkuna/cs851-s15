If the hotel you're considering hasn't been given the Oyster fakeout treatment, you can still look for truth in advertising by checking out user-submitted photos on TripAdvisor. While the quality of the photos varies -- expect a few dark and blurry shots mixed into the gallery -- these undoctored images will give you a much more realistic vision of what a hotel's rooms and public spaces look like.
