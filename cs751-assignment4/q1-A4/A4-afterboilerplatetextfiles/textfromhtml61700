ourses are aimed at giving you the opportunity to learn how to use ice axes and crampons, master navigation in difficult conditions, and also to spend time looking at evaluating the snowpack for avalanche dangers, using mountain weather forecasts to enable safe travel in the mountains, and drawing from your instructor's experience to pick up a thousand and one tips to make your future winter walking trips fun and safe. Oh, and we'll do all of this on some of the finest mountains in Snowdonia and Scotland!
