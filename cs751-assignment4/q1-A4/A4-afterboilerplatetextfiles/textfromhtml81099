that, because we simply could not afford it. So we took out the furniture from our camper van and adjusted it to fit into the Land Rover. So we have got storage for food and cloth, a bench to sit with table and an emergency bed, which is rather small but it is just for emergency. We bought two tents, a small one for one night stays, which is quickly pitched and a larger one, if we stay longer at a place which provides more comfort. So we had a space problem which we solved as follows: The sand ladders were fitted outside at the rear side windows, which are also a kind of protection against theft, and we had bought the Land Rover with a roof rack, where we build a simple box on it (thanks Rick from Kamanjab, Namibia, who helped us a lot and gave us an awning for the side). Aside the box we fitted the spare jerry cans. All the conversion was done in Oppi Koppi rest camp, Namibia, where Vital and Marianne provided the tools and space where we could work on the Land Rover. Thanks to them as well. Now the basic vehicle was finished, but it was lacking some decoration, so Andrea from Gelbingen Guest Farm painted animal footprints and black people on the Land Rover, which later turned out was a great help, because all police men were laughing about the vehicle and checks were done quite easy. Thanks Andrea! The basic conversion was finished and we could start.
