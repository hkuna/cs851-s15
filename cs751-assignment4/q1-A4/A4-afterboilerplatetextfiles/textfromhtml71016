Alexander’s writing style is clear and crisp. His characters are finely-drawn and complex enough to keep the reader’s attention. I loved the mystery and dis-illuminate story lines, which criss-crossed and finally converged in a disturbing ending. “Visions of a Reject” might feed your fears that the world isn’t really getting better, and it might persuade you to finally escape from your sad white cubicle. Or it might simply tell you what you already knew, deep down. That the world as we know it, isn’t really as we know it.
