Thanks for sharing your amusing thoughts about Dionne's post as well. Your "meddling" is allowing me to find all kinds of good posts and conversations that I wouldn't have found otherwise. Kudos!
down to your trusted general store to buy from your family friend. Only now that general store spans the entire world! Very cool. It's kind of like 'The Waltons' or 'Little House on the Prairie' on a global scale. (I know, geezer alert) 'Word of mouth' can be spread worldwide in minutes. It's frightening for marketers that don't understand the environment they're now playing in. On the other hand, it's a massive opportunity for savvy marketers that can build trust and add value. Honesty will win the day...how wonderful.
