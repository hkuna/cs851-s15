By the way, congrats to WWE for shutting up the haters by reaching 1 million subscribers.
ollins is what carried the show. That match was tremendous, and an early candidate for "Match of The Year". Everyone was amazing in this match, as they all kicked out of each other's Finishers. Seth Rollins nailed Brock Lesnar with a great left Elbow Drop on the Announce Table. Rollins showed his flashes of brilliance and put everyone on further notice that he will take that top spot for years to come. Cena nailed Lesnar with 3 Attitude Adjustments. Brock showed once more why he is Truly a Beast. After Rollins took care of Cena, he was ready to nail another Curb Stomp on the Champ. Then, plans changed as Brock rose quickly to catch him to nail the final blow with The F-5 to retain his WWE Championship. The stage was set for Brock Lesnar to main event WrestleMania as WWE Champion the moment that he broke the Streak, and defeated John Cena at Summerslam. It only made sense for Lesnar to hold it this long considering what he had accomplished. There have been twists and turns in the plot leading up, but overall this has been the course that WWE has set their minds on taking. At least, for once the IWC takes their hate off of Cena. He could at least relax for now. This is the marquee caliber Main Event that WWE has set in stone for WM 31. This is a battle of the Young Lion taking on the Veteran Lion. The Original Next Big Thing versus the Current Next Big Thing. Overall, I give this PPV a C+.
