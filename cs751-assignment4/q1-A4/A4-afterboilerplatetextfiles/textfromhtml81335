The goal of this blog is to read some scripture everyday. It may be one verse, one paragraph, a chapter or two. There is no set goal to reach. The only objective is to collectively inspire each other in what we read together. What do we understand?? What captures our attention?? What has meaning to us on a daily basis as we read?? Your comments are very much needed and welcomed.
