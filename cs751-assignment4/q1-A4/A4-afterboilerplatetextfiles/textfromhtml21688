The SIPRI Arms Transfers Database is constantly being revised and updated as new information becomes available. For this reason, information previously extracted from the database, or contained in previous editions of the SIPRI Yearbook, may now be incorrect. If you wish to use information from the database it is therefore best to access data here as and when you need it. All information from the database is available for use free of charge on the proviso that the 'terms and conditions' are abided by.
