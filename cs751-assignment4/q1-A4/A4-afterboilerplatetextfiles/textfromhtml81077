my requirements for sleeping in the morning:is the surface vaguely horizontal and not made entirely out of hornets
eight on each other? are my arms tucked in nicely and not at odd angles? can I stop thinking about the day's events? is enough of my body out from under the blanket that I won't overheat? are my toes safely tucked in to hide them from monsters?
