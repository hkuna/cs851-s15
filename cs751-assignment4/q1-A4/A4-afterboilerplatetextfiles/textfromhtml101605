The length to which government bureaucrats will go to waste tax payer monies on utterly foolish if not out right dangerous projects is astounding. Clearly, the amount of money available to the loons that make up our federal bureaucracy should be slashed in half as Warren Harding once did with laudable consequences. "The essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse." --James Madison
