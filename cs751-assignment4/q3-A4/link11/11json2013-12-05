Thank you all so much for the amazing month that has been August 2013. I wanted to do something fun for you, and although it was initially daunting to do a collaboration every single week-day in August, it turned out so successful. Thanks to those who were a part of each video and were so helpful while coordinating uploads - and thanks to those of you who tuned in every day. I couldn't have kept going without the excitement y'all returned to me every day on Twitter, Tumblr, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and in person. I adore you all and can't wait to take you on more insane adventures on this channel in the future!
