There are a few problems with your statement (and I use the word "your" in the very loosest sense of the word :D). To begin with, Christians do not believe Jesus was a "Cosmic Jewish Zombie" - this isn't some sort of George A. Romero version of the silver surfer we're talking about here - its God. The word "cosmic" says nothing about the character of a infinite, omnipresent, omnipotent, ominscient God; nor does the mistaken belief that Jesus was some sort of "zombie" - a "zombie" is an undead human - not God made incarnate in human flesh.Nor was Jesus "his own father" - Jesus described himself as a "Son of God" by means of explaining the unique relationship that existed between himself and God the Father. It was the best means available,ï»¿ within the boundaries of human lexicon, of explaining the unique nature of the bond between Jesus and God the Father. Jesus is God, he is no more a son than God can be, say, a daffodil.
