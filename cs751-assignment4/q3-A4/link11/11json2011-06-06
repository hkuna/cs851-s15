Ps. In the coment it seems like Im completely dissing you, but I'm not. I clearly says that I actually voted for you in NextUp, every time you uploaded a vid reminding people to vote. Infact, you're the only one I voted. I like most of your vids, and I think your hilarious and entertaining, but I just thought that the "How to take over" vid was rubbish. I know its not nice to hear, especially as its you personal experience of what looks like an amazing trip... but I was bored 20 secs in to a vid that could have been so epic. So, as you always do, I said what was on my mind.ï»¿ (Even though I made the mistake of thinking you won NextUp)
