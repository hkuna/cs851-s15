so it's 4 in the morning and if it wasn't for a killer migraine i'd be sleeping but i can't and i'm almost thankful for it because i came across one of your videos and then your page and it reminded me why i love YouTube so much. people like you with such funny cute entertaining content. keep it up. i'm definitely subscribing and looking forward to more﻿ stuff by you.
 your FaceBook﻿ videos put a smile in my face every single time I watch them :) So I just want to say thank you, you are just lovely to watch :DP.S: "it's not the size of the wave, it's the motion of the ocean" is inspire by The Bad Touch song? Oh and is it possible to upload a video and make a restriction so only my friends can watch it?
