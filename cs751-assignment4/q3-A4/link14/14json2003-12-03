The second, and perhaps better way is to buy a copy of my recently published book of poetry. It is called Poetry for All the Family, follow the link for more information. It is not expensive and should be thoroughly enjoyable, so if you like it please tell people about it, or better still give it to someone as a present for Christmas of a birthday.
 that way you make me 2 or 3 cents a time, not a lot but it adds up.
