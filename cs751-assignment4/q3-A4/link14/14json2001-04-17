These pages are here free for you to use, I would like to keep them that way, however making and running this site, and the other sites I am currently making or have made, on Birds, Mammals, Insects and Fish and Bacteria costs money. There are simple ways you can help. By using the search engines here you make me 2 or 3 cents a time, by buying goods from Discovery Store you also help. Using these search engines costs you nothing and you will be helping maintain and create one of the best educational resources on the web, as of January 01 2001 I will be working full-time on these sites and all I will have to live on will be the revenue earned from the sites so I really need your support.
