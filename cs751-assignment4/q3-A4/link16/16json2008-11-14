Answer:If you are a beginner at stock investing I would suggest that you invest through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds rather than individual stocks. That way you get diversification across the broad market without having to worry about the number of shares you need to buy of any particular stock. You also get some shielding from risk while you get familar with stock investing.
