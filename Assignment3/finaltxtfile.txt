One Power 106 is enough!!! We don't need another wannabe station to play the same damn thing. In the first place, Power 106 rules the hip hop roost. The selection of music 92.3 played was appreciated by listeners of different generations. That in itself speaks volumes of what a great station it was. If rumors are true, that these people look down on the type of music 92.3 broadcasted, then maybe Jimmy Reyes and the rest of the 92.3 crew are better off. I would never want to be under that type of administration, because selling out should never be an option. 92.3 truly was the only station of it's kind. I wish everyone at 92.3 all the best on their journey to bigger and brighter opportunities. By the way, The Love Affair was off the hook!!!! Thank you, Art Laboe, Jimmy Reyes, Josefa Salinas, Rene Taylor, and the rest of the 92.3 crew for all the wonderful years of service to all your listeners.

National Health Insurance Scheme will subsidise premium for community-based schemes for pregnant women and children under age five in efforts to push up coverage. The subsidized health packages will last three years, according to NHIS chief executive Dr Femi Thomas.It came as the scheme flagged off Community-Based Social Health Insurance for communities in Gwiwa Sire, in Wamakko Local Government Area of Sokoto State.According to him, the scheme has spent more than N1.2b to provide care for pregnant women and children below 5 years of age under an maternal and child health programme since 2008 in six council areas of Sokoto—Kebbe, Yabo, Binji, Tangaza, Sabon-Birni and Isa.Speaking at the occasion, the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Gwiwa Sire Mutual Health Association, Abubakar Usman Basakwace called on the state government to provide the association with a piece of land to build a healthcare facility within the community, in order to bring healthcare services to the door steps of their members.In his reaction, the Governor of Sokoto State, Aliyu Wamakko, who was represented by the Commissioner for Livestock and Animal Health, Garba Sanda, assured that Sokoto state would partner with NHIS to bring the benefits of health insurance to the people of the state.Several communities across the country are at various stages of preparedness for the formal take-off of the community based social health insurance programme, evidence that the worrisome apathy to health insurance is abating rapidly across the country.

Spend it at the movies, spend it reading your favorite book, or you could even spend hanging out in bed all day. Everyone needs time to themselves every once in a while — it’s important to take care of yourself, clear your mind, and recharge your batteries. TREAT YOURSELF and enjoy the day :)

Large amounts of radioactive substances were released into the environment from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plants in eastern Japan as a consequence of the great earthquake (M 9.0) and tsunami of 11 March 2011. Radioactive substances discharged into the atmosphere first reached the Chiba Metropolitan Area on 15 March. We collected daily samples of air, fallout deposition, and tap water starting directly after the incident and measured their radioactivity. During the first two months maximum daily concentrations of airborne radionuclides observed at the Japan Chemical Analysis Center in the Chiba Metropolitan Area were as follows: 4.7 × 10(1) Bq m(-3) of (131)I, 7.5 Bq m(-3) of (137)Cs, and 6.1 Bq m(-3) of (134)Cs. The ratio of gaseous iodine to total iodine ranged from 5.2 × 10(-1) to 7.1 × 10(-1). Observed deposition rate maxima were as follows: 1.7 × 10(4) Bq m(-2) d(-1) of (131)I, 2.9 × 10(3) Bq m(-2) d(-1) of (137)Cs, and 2.9 × 10(3) Bq m(-2) d(-1) of (134)Cs. The deposition velocities (ratio of deposition rate to concentration) of cesium radionuclides and (131)I were detectably different. Radioactivity in tap water caused by the accident was detected several days after detection of radioactivity in fallout in the area. Radiation doses were estimated from external radiation and internal radiation by inhalation and ingestion of tap water for people living outdoor in the Chiba Metropolitan Area following the Fukushima accident.

With regard to Putin and what’s happened in Ukraine, the fact is, he, right, is now in Ukraine, or his military forces, in however many numbers, are in Ukraine. We’re in this mess. And the question is: How do we get out of it? And I would argue that using big stick diplomacy, which almost everybody in the American national security elite loves to do, is not going to fix the problem. We have been using the big stick in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in Libya, and we’ve made a mess everywhere we’ve gone. It’s going to be the same story again if we do arming of the Ukrainians. It’s not going to work. It’s just going to escalate the violence, more Ukrainians are going to die, the Russians are going to redouble their efforts, and the crisis is going to escalate. And as I said early on, you want to remember that you’re dealing with a country that has thousands of nuclear warheads and thinks its core strategic interests are at stake. If you put that country in a precarious position, you put Putin in a situation where he feels desperate, it’s not clear what he’ll do. And given he has nuclear weapons, I don’t want to go down that road.

I heartily endorse subguns for a variety of different types of operations. I think their role needs to be re-examined by American law enforcement. Here are a few reasons why: pistol-round lethality has improved dramatically over the last 10 years, subguns are far more controllable than carbines, hearing injuries to officers are far less with pistol rounds, and officers tend to become proficient in their use at a far quicker rate than when using carbines in rifle calibers. The KRISS Vector SDP .45 ACP pistol is not technically a subgun because it does not have a stock. It has the advantage of being more concealable, yet offers fast, accurate rounds on target in an instant. The unique characteristics of the KRISS SDP make it far more controllable under rapid fire than anything else I have ever tested.

In order to see truly major results, Fryben suggests doing 10 to 20 consecutive treatments as close together as possible (preferably every day), taking a break for about two months, and repeating. "Since you can't stay in the machine for more than three minutes, you need to do it more often in order for the inflammation to be decreased," explains Fryben. But at $90 a session, it looks like I would need to freeze my spending habits and really throw all my earnings at cryotherapy before I can have legs like Gisele Bündchen.

e. That blood is being nourished with enzymes and oxygen, and it is being delivered to every single cell in your body so you can perform at the highest level." That explains the glow. As for my thinner thighs, cryotherapy is known to curb cortisol levels—the hormone responsible for water retention. Fast and effective: no wonder models like Crystal Renn and Maryna Linchuk turn to cryotherapy. (Dudes seem to like it too, with Daniel Craig reportedly using cryotherapy to get in shape for Skyfall.)

“While our algorithm produces a superior result on this particular dataset, this does not indicate that machine vision outperforms human vision on object recognition in general,” they wrote. “On recognizing elementary object categories (i.e., common objects or concepts in daily lives) such as the Pascal VOC task, machines still have obvious errors in cases that are trivial for humans. Nevertheless, we believe that our results show the tremendous potential of machine algorithms to match human-level performance on visual recognition.”

High-performing organizations are more successful because they emphasize strategy, improve efficiency and — perhaps most tellingly — cultivate talent resources that embrace these practices to deliver successful programs and projects.

The plot is sub-Hitchhiker’s Guide/Guardians of the Galaxy bunkum about extravagantly coiffured extraterrestrials who rule Earth from afar, but whose plans to “harvest” its riches are confounded by the genetic resurgence of intergalactic royalty in the unsuspecting shape of toilet-cleaning Mila Kunis (she is the one!). Channing Tatum is the wolf/man hybrid who plays Clark Kent to Kunis’s Lois Lane (a recurrent Wachowski trope), swooping around on jet-boot rollerblades as we careen through starship dogfights, massive interplanetary shoot-em-ups, and endless incongruous stick-on ears. At one point, the whole thing becomes Brazil in space, replete with a Terry Gilliam cameo. It’s absolute nonsense, with each new world more fantastically overdressed than the last, and dialogue that would make George Lucas cringe. Top marks go to evil space royal Eddie Redmayne, whose breathy ennui is offset by bouts of mummy’s boy shrieking, all delivered with a “petite-mort” look on his face that suggests he is being fellated by eternity itself.

Dad and Earnie made their big entrance as Al Capone with his gun moll. He wore a pin striped suit, black shirt, spats, Fedora with a red feather in it...had a scar penciled on his forehead, and carried a toy machine gun. He was of course, the life of the party and you could hear his voice and laughter above the roar of the crowd. The party was a rip roaring success and Gene and I were really happy we had a big beautiful house to entertain both our families in. Gene's stereo and speakers I'd won the money for from Santa Anita's opening day, finally had a place in the cabinet granddaddy made for him. And, the house came alive with disco music, and dancing all nignt long. However, I have to say, it was a little weird not having Nana at such a great event... with her style, laughter and love of fun, but it was also nice not having to deal with her constant demand for attention and control. She must have been there in spirit, because everyone asked about her and though nobody knew too much about what was going on in Arkansas, We all bet it included a lot of high drama.

 Mary wore her Mary costume that she wore everywhere...a Fushia colored dress suit, with a black hat, gloves and lace up granny shoes. What a character she was and she sat on the new sofa all night just watching granddaddy have fun. Finally when she couldn't stand it another minute, she said "Andy, it's time to go".

With regards to branding a startup, if your product is any good, and even if it is not, you will become known for something so either harness your brand early or let your customers define your story. The latter usually leads to rebranding and costs more in time and resources–including money. I gather that’s what Starbuck’s experienced…. Since doing business is the primary outcome of those targeted in this article, me thinks branding is essential alongside product development.

‘The Metal East’, the album's opener, "sets the tone" for the rest of the record, according to Chippendale, thundering through four minutes of sinister low-end rumbles, skittish percussion and animal screams. Dark and haunting? Yes. But a tonne of fun too. The pair's live shows are a thing of legend, typically setting up on the floor in the middle of the crowd, like something out of a pandemonious guerrilla rave. I've still got some bruises from the last Lightning Bolt show I went to, and that was in 2008. A breathless rollercoaster of lysergic riffs, 'The Metal East' will fit in right at home live amidst fan-favourites like 'Dracula Mountain' and 'Assassins'. Give it a listen below and keep an eye out for 'Fantasy Empire', out on March 23.

Such a radical intervention is necessary, the council insists, because little progress has been made so far in addressing social deprivation and poor housing conditions.

Now do I have to search for peace of mind? I know I do not have to. The only thing I have to do is live today. Peace of mind, is a question of what will happen in the future. It is an anxiety brought about by the events that has not happened yet. Although part of the problem is the change that is happening at present, but this feeling of uncertainty is due to thinking of what may happen. I know I cannot control the future. Instead, I just have to decide living today. Regardless of what the problem will be, I still have today to live. Perhaps thinking of today could ease the anxiety and attain peace of mind today. :-)

At its heart this is a G63, so power is likely to be disproportionate to handling ability. Its 5.5-litre twin-turbo V8 serves up 537bhp, and given the extra weight of all that armour cladding (as well as its extra length), we'd reckon a lot of those horses will be munched up by the traction control if you arrive too ambitiously at a corner.

I wanted to like this book more than I did. It did hold my interest and I learned more about the extent of the Armenian genocide. Unfortunately, I thought the storytelling was choppy. The two plot lines never came together coherently for me. I suspect that my impression of this book suffered because I'd recently read The Garden of Evening Mists. Both books deal with similar themes and situations. Tan Twan Eng did a far better job with multiple time lines and the themes of war and survival.

The Nike KD7 has seen its fair share of refashioning, but no other models warrant the same sentiment to Kevin Durant as the KD7 “Aunt Pearl.” As a eulogy to his late aunt who succumbed to lung cancer in 2001, Durant had an angel depiction placed on his back in the form of a tattoo. Nike designer Leo Chang articulated Durant’s memory of Aunt Pearl by creating a customized sneaker based on Durant’s tributary artwork. A three-dimensional wing strap, inscribed with a touching acknowledgment to his aunt and an endorsement of the Kay Yow Cancer Fund for whom Nike has been a supporter of for seven years, graces the front of the shoe while an imprint of Durant’s tattoo is embedded on the inside of the tongue. The KD7 “Aunt Pearl” shoe will be available beginning February 19 at Nike.com and select retail locations globally.

More for after the book’s written and they hope to sell it – I’ve realized by looking at tons of books through blog hops and just general reviews how important the cover design is to me. We have a digital library as part of Seattle Public Library, and I browse all the time looking for new things. The covers have to be polished to get me to even open up the page and read the description. If it looks amateurish, I tend to skip over it. Or, if it’s got a hot guy without a shirt on on the cover, I tend to skip. Whenever I’ve tried those kinds of books, it seems like the authors focus more on the sex scenes than the rest of the story, like they’re just filling pages between them to get it to a book length. I’ve seen too many books where, if it’s in first person, the speaker’s tone just completely changes and it feels like a different character. I don’t have a problem with content, I just don’t like feeling like I’m yanked out of the story. I’m probably overlooking some books that are actually pretty great filtering like this, but there are so many other options to read now that I just don’t take the time. You know? Or maybe I’m way more superficial when selecting a book to read than others.

The research comes at the same that time the White House is pushing new rules for America's flood-prone buildings, which put climate science at the center of federal regulations. At the end of last month, President Obama issued an executive order to implement a new "Federal Flood Risk Management Standard," designed to reduce risks and cut the costs of future flood disasters. But the president's plan is being met by Republican opposition—mainly from senators whose states border the Gulf of Mexico. These lawmakers question the legality of the executive order and imply that the White House didn't do enough to solicit input before drafting the order.

It's time to sew that cynicism up.

Flu season isn’t over yet. It still has a few weeks until it ends, and thousands of Americans have been afflicted with the fevers and sneezes that come with this year’s nasty H3N2 strain. For acute cases, doctors typically recommend bed rest, but what that really means can be confusing to patients. One expert, Daniel Neides, medical director of the Wellness Institute at Cleveland Clinic, explains why lying down isn’t always necessary and how cool temperatures and hydration are important factors in kicking the infection.

“We want it to hit hard, and not just in a music aspect, but meaning-wise too," says vocalist Keaton Pierce. "Every transition of song, every word, every note that’s played, we want people to feel something from it. There are no gaps in songs where we just throw something there because we need something to go there. Everything’s carefully placed and planned to keep the listener entranced. We want it to be a different experience than just somebody listening to a record. It’s a story that you tell."

He said he had no difficulty at all in coming to the decision to sponsor the construction of the museum because it coincided with his personal belief that, “no matter where one is born, one could make an impact and contribute to” the well-being of the society.

“The failings of this era very much reflect what young people are now saying about police shootings,” Stevenson said. “It is about embracing this idea that ‘black lives matter’,” he added. “I also think that the lynching era created a narrative of racial difference, a presumption of guilt, a presumption of dangerousness that got assigned to African Americans in particular – and that’s the same presumption of guilt that burdens young kids living in urban areas who are sometimes menaced, threatened, or shot and killed by law enforcement officers.”

14. The dark side of illegal immigration: Nearly one million sex crimes are committed by illegal immigrants in the United States!



uk http://malsfactory.blogspot.co.uk revised & expanded edition 24 April 2012 GETHSEMANE A type of Gethsemane. Not so much the pain – more the agony. Not the absence of sleep – more the ache; an ache which penetrates each sinew. If only one had slept like others do. Oh, how you’d love that luxury. Wait for the next event – everything burns, each pore secretes anxiety. Has it all come to this? Who knows what follows the restless night. Malcolm Evison 09 June 2005 ACCORDION Sometimes I feel like an accordion squeezed by some disembodied self each chord vibrates bruised reeds each inspiration teases out a latent voice - rarely to be sustained - almost as if it chokes on its own respiration. Malcolm Evison 29 September -02 October 2009 THE BODY SNATCHERS The body snatchers called and found me void – where once there was a vibrant heart, and thoughts teemed endlessly around - a residue of aches and pains delineates the core - and Sisyphus rejoices to have found a new companion. Malcolm Evison 30 June 2005 BEING God spoke – I dare not listen. I could not face the stillness of simply being there. God spoke: there were no words – I simply saw the suffering of others. I could not share the stillness of simply being there. One day I knew God could not speak - I used my eyes, I saw and felt the suffering of multitudes – I listened to their cries – then cautiously I whispered “I am here” and from my helplessness I knew - that God was there. Malcolm Evison 28 July 2005 AUBADE (sans le soleil) Wrapped futilely in the realm of beauty sleep – dawn rarely dawns on me. Long after the appointed hour, the room is thunder-black - draw back the curtains. The sky has lost its breathing space – choked by the clouds, voluptuously hanging in their mourning drapes – symbolic of a troubled world. I sigh, and seek the duvet’s solace – for me the day has not yet quite begun. Malcolm Evison 26 October 2006 CONSULTATION These visits are by now routine - on entering the lion's den, expect a smile and beckoning wave to take a seat. Obediently, you sit and start to contemplate time's passage. Words fail, as always, to express the visit's raison d'etre. Malcolm Evison 5 July 2005 EMERGING and this morning still abed my legs are mercury laden knitted lead the arms folded or stretched scream out for postures new Restless Night frantic and static collude to break the spirit - the chorussed scream of roll and stretch weaves counterpoint against the searing ache of stasis - the chinese burn of movement resists the planned escape Malcolm Evison 30/01/11 – 01/02/11 ON REFLECTION Sunshine on puddled rain reflects the pride of plants refreshed by elemental forces it lifts my spirits I hope they won't evaporate as I bask calmly in the afterglow. Malcolm Evison 21 May 2009 Flutter By Moment it alights softer than a whisper on my sleeve almost as if it sought me out I sit relax breathe in the gentle air - the butterfly spreads out its wings - this moment I am at one with nature sharing the fragility imagining a place where all could feel secure - wearing the butterfly like a heart on my sleeve Malcolm Evison 17 July 2008 RECLAMATION Just another lightly throbbing gritty grey day a second chance to modify one’s outlook divert one’s gaze away from the reality - begin to play the game of life regained. Malcolm Evison 29 January 2009 SPLASH INTO SPRING A sprinkling splash, a sudden flash of ruddy gold - the first spring stirrings. A long, slow, turgid rest supplanted by these vital chimes. Today they share the sunshine's joy - and ripple wilfully. Last seasons debris stirred and shaken, the fish escape their sedimentary rest, herald the promise of brighter days to come. Like me, they must have felt they'd plumbed the depths for far too long. Malcolm Evison 14 March 2007 RUDE AWAKENING The telephonic shrill urgents me blearily into dawn. Discomfited I roll myself across a seeming endless counterpane, set foot on an insecure floor, retrieve the handset and receive a droning earful. Bliss was it in that dawn to be asleep, to be awakened serves to remind oneself they’re far from heaven. Malcolm Evison 4 August 2007 A PALE REFLECTION The shadows of the taller trees cast silhouettes across the pool - they overlay a pale reflection of the more immediate scene. Sometimes I fail to grasp immediate delights allow my darker memories to shield me from the light. Malcolm Evison 21 May 2009 SHATTERED he rails exhaustedly against the unrelenting night - shattered by restlessness he groans a welcome to a new daybreak prays that it's not an uninvited dream - still rails against the unrelenting night then collapses into sleep Malcolm Evison 10 September 2011 just another day striving to ignore the sundry aches and pains the flesh is heir to I sit and watch the rains incessant flow – birds flit from shrubbery to feeders wallow in puddle baths - I struggle with a vague desire to don a coat wonder if I dare venture out to taste the sodden air Malcolm Evison 19 April 2012

regularly I do lip rolls (after an initial few minutes I lip roll to a couple of songs with varying vocal ranges) and vocal fry and one or two others that are hard to explain in words (ha) as these have worked in getting me ready to go. But I sometimes wonder if singing as much as I do, with many songs having a significant vocal range, i.e. NY NY, My Way, Beyond the Sea and Mack the Knife and although I don't strain, these are the first songs to go when I start experiencing any vocal issues.. so I would love to do exercises that would prevent vocal issues if at all possible. let me know the next step.

This being Israel, everything could change between now and March 17. Labour only has to edge a single seat ahead of Likud for Netanyahu to be finished. But right now his opponents look like a team facing an open goal and poised to miss. They need to raise their game – and fast. Otherwise he will renew the lease on an office he has come to regard as his own. Of course a change at the top will arrive eventually – but Israel itself might have to change first.

A few other notes from Monday night: Fox’s Gotham (5.6 million, 1.8 in the demo) slipped this week as it hurriedly assured its introducing the Joker soon. Sleepy Hollow (3.9 million, 1.2) continued to struggle. ABC’s Bachelor (8.6 million, 2.7) rose and ranked as the night’s top-rated show. NBC’s State of Affairs (4 million, 1.0) didn’t help its renewal odds.

The universities have been making a fuss, but the government has other, less well-defended targets: local authorities, schools, doctors, hospitals, the prison and probation services are all included, even after-school clubs. In the government’s view, the smallest Muslim child needs to be watched for signs of extremism. There was always a risk that identity politics would be turned into a cultural war, the majority versus the rest. We don’t hurl racist abuse anymore, not in public. We say ‘extremist’.

ter, and in particular those who seek to understand the impact of the colonial and post-colonial powers on Muslim people around the world. Is it ‘extreme’ to point to the hypocrisy of a country that engages in illegal wars against defenceless people around the world while insisting on the importance of ‘democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance’? Or to follow the logic of the postwar anti-colonial movement and say that the killing of occupying forces is sometimes necessary. I will be able to go on saying things like this. But if what were proposed was an account of Isis by a visiting imam, or an event attacking Israel’s occupation of Palestine, there would be nervous shifting of feet, visits from Special Branch, strong representations from foreign governments. The event would probably never take place: the new committee of the university would turn such a speaker down as not worth the flak such a visit would inevitably entail. This is a new Cold War.

• When Princess Leia Organa was captured by the Empire as a Rebel spy, she never betrayed her convictions, even in the face of the complete destruction of her home world, Alderaan. When her rescue came, she grabbed a blaster and joined the fight, escaping back to the Rebel Alliance and helping strike the biggest blow against the Empire-the destruction of the Death Star. But in the aftermath of that victory, the question remains...what is a princess without a world? • Writer Mark Waid (Daredevil, S.H.I.E.L.D.) and artist Terry Dodson (Avengers & X-Men: Axis, Uncanny X-Men) bring us a story of Leia's quest to help her people and find her place in the galaxy.

Good evening from the kid. If you are ever in the area and need some seafood, Big Daddys Seafood & Rib Ranch located in South Jersey,Williamstown, to be exact. This new crab shack is family owned, I mean the husband, wife, sons and niece!! I will tell you one thing, this family does their DAMN THANG!!! The fish, both Whiting and Catfish, are on point. The crabs are juicy and full of Big Daddys Seafood and Rib Ranch secret spices. Prices are reasonable for the amount of food that they give and service is great. Mitch is usually upfront and will be the first one you see when you pull up. Just expect a conversation while you eat (which is not a bad thing). The service reminds me of the old time restaurants. It reminds me of a time when everyone spoke to each other and an eatery was a place of great conversation and people just having fun. At Big Daddys, you have the option of sitting at the “bar”, in your car or taking your order to go. I have not tried the whole menu yet but I promise you, as I try different things, I will post about it. Expect to hear a lot of thing about this great family owned seafood shack. My family and I will be back and back and back again. So again, if you are in the area, please stop by. You can also find them on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube. Just search Big Daddys Seafood and Rib Ranch.

HARRISONBURG, VA—Saying there were plenty of other things to snack on, local mom Susan Weiss announced Friday that she has a plan for the tub of whipped cream in the refrigerator, so no one is allowed to eat it. “I’m making a new recipe, and the last thing I want to see when I open that tub is a big scoop taken out,” said Weiss, adding that everyone will get to eat it on Sunday when the McCormicks come over. “If there’s any left over, you can have some then. But if you’re really hungry now, you can have those grapes or heat up the fajitas from last night.” Weiss went on to say that no one should be scrounging around the kitchen anyway because dinner would be ready in an hour.

Lastly, there is nothing wrong with achieving, as long as one does not forget to find one's purpose and make a commitment for it. There should be a balance between the two. Better if we make our life goals towards our personal achievements in line or parallel with our purpose in life. In this way, we do something for ourselves and for others using the same effort and direction in life.

for others is the single most important factor for one to realize his or her purpose in life.

What a fabulous idea!! Not sure what size your cards will be but it would also be great to take the Shabbos/Holiday candle blessing and hand washing blessing cards and laminate them– and have additional ones to the set so they could be say 3″x 5″ or 4″ x 6″ and put on little lucite easels. That way you can have the candle blessing sit by your shabbos/ holiday candlesticks and the hand washing blessing sit near the sink. Love the graphics!!!

Ramsey’s first album is magical. I can’t wait to see what he’s come up with for his second one, already titled Gentilly. Ramsey is using topnotch backing musicians, including harmonica great Mickey Raphael of Willie Nelson’s band. The songs are surely going to be something special. Will it top his first album? Based on some of the songs he’s played at concerts that are pegged for the second album, I predict it’ll be every bit as good. Maybe better.

“This is tremendous news for the hard-working people of West Virginia who deserve the opportunity for a good job, especially in the Eastern Panhandle where residents will have a chance to work closer to home. Procter & Gamble’s decision to build a major manufacturing facility at the Tabler Station Business Park speaks volumes about the potential of West Virginia’s manufacturing sector and the need to invest in infrastructure projects. Ten years ago, I was proud to help obtain a federal grant for infrastructure work at the Tabler Station Business Park. I am even more proud today to see that investment led to such a major economic development project. I will continue fighting for infrastructure investments that will strengthen our economy, create jobs, and put West Virginia on the map as a manufacturing destination. Welcome to West Virginia, Procter & Gamble.”

Background It belongs to the Indo-European family, Slavonic group, East Slavonic subgroup and is spoken by over 290 million people, including second language users, in all countries. Russian was the lingua franca of the Russian Empire and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR); it is still used as a second language in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. Russian includes three groups of dialects: northern, southern, and central. Literary Russian is essentially based on the central dialect of Moscow. The Russian language uses the Cyrillic alphabet, which originated from the first translation of the Christian Bible into a Slavic language (Paleoslav, or ancient Bulgarian, spoken in what is modern Macedonia, from which all Slavic languages descended), by Saint Methodius and Saint Cyril of Constantinople, in the 9th century. Subsequent to the 1918 reform of Russian orthography, certain letters of the alphabet were suppressed and spelling rules simplified. In Russian grammar verbs generally have two aspects, each represented by a separate infinitive: the "imperfective" to indicate a continuing action, and the "perfective" to indicate an action already completed or to be completed. The stress in Russian is also particularly difficult, impossible to predict in an unfamiliar word, and frequently shifting in the course of declensions or conjugations.

If the Kochs hit their $889 million target, they will essentially function as a third party in US politics, and they can expect far greater scrutiny and criticism as their operation continues to grow. But those close to the brothers and their network do not expect them to be spooked by even more attention. "If you're going to play in this arena, you don't play only when it's lukewarm, you play when it gets hot, too, and it's gotten hot," Nestor Weigand, a friend of Charles Koch and Freedom Partners board member, told Mother Jones editor and Koch biographer Daniel Schulman. "They're still playing."

men lack words of wisdom. So, I curated a list of my favorite quotes -- from luminaries living and dead, activists and athletes, authors and actors, leaders and lovers -- all women. Each of these is powerful in its own right; together, they form a motivational stew, encouraging you to seize life and sprint towards success.

People on low fat diets look drawn, gaunt, and weak. They are often sick, sometimes to the point of literally breaking down. And, they can never just enjoy eating out. Every meal and every gram must be accounted for. Do you really think this will make you younger? Of course not... it will worry you to death if it doesn't kill you first!

Among the afflictions and indignities borne by the homeless, the surreal news of a Medicaid scheme that preyed on them - perpetrators made millions by recruiting the poor for bogus medical tests in exchange for free shoes - is uncommonly vile. Most days, the homeless are just shunned, scorned, ignored and assailed, as a new campaign by an advocacy group makes grievously clear. Watch homeless people read vicious tweets about themselves. Then weep for the species.

“Don’t Kill the Fun” features Chris Brown, who harmonizes quite nicely with Streeter. In fact, they go together so well that Brown directed the video for “Don’t Kill the Fun,” which sends both Brown and Streeter into an old-school dance battle on a graffiti-soaked rooftop. Streeter gets to show off some slick moves, and between her dancing and her super-cool coo, it’s no wonder she cites the late Aaliyah as a major influence.

Just like us, the monarch butterfly sometimes gets sick thanks to a nasty parasite. But biologist Jaap de Roode noticed something interesting about the butterflies he was studying — infected female butterflies would choose to lay their eggs on a specific kind of plant that helped their offspring avoid getting sick. How do they know to choose this plant? Think of it as “the other butterfly effect” — which could teach us to find new medicines for the treatment of human disease.

When Vince Vaughnrelisted his five bedroom triplex penthouse in the landmark Palmolive Building last September, the A-lister did so without including any interior photos of the space. However, over the weekend, the 12,000 square foot penthouse publicly listed on the MLS with a $1 million price chop and some new interior shots. The penthouse takes up the top three floors of the historic Art Deco building, a space that housed the headquarters of Hugh Hefner's Playboy Enterprises from the mid-'60s to the late '80s. Vaughn's listing agent told DNAinfo that the actor is "not desperate in any way" to ditch the swanky triplex space, however with a million-dollar price cut and some new photos Vaughn is certainly offering a little more bait to lure potential buyers.

Rollins showed his flashes of brilliance and put everyone on further notice that he will take that top spot for years to come. Cena nailed Lesnar with 3 Attitude Adjustments. Brock showed once more why he is Truly a Beast. After Rollins took care of Cena, he was ready to nail another Curb Stomp on the Champ. Then, plans changed as Brock rose quickly to catch him to nail the final blow with The F-5 to retain his WWE Championship. The stage was set for Brock Lesnar to main event WrestleMania as WWE Champion the moment that he broke the Streak, and defeated John Cena at Summerslam. It only made sense for Lesnar to hold it this long considering what he had accomplished. There have been twists and turns in the plot leading up, but overall this has been the course that WWE has set their minds on taking. At least, for once the IWC takes their hate off of Cena. He could at least relax for now. This is the marquee caliber Main Event that WWE has set in stone for WM 31. This is a battle of the Young Lion taking on the Veteran Lion. The Original Next Big Thing versus the Current Next Big Thing. Overall, I give this PPV a C+.

I think that when historians look back at the post-war Commonwealth immigration they will note of course the ethnic transformation that some like Enoch Powell correctly foresaw but wrongfully and dangerously diagnosed as leading to ‘a race war’; but they will also note the religious transformation of this country that no one at the time foresaw. These two transformations are working their effects across so many features of social, economic and political life but one which I think we have been slow to recognise is what it means in terms of the place of religion and belief in British public life. Unfortunately, for too many politicians and others this question is too dominated by issues of extremism, violence and terrorism. Such phenomena are exceptional and it is a great mistake to judge religion, not to mention Muslims and Islam, in such fearful terms. We need to think of not just the harm that some militants can do but about the good that religion has to offer, not just to individuals but to communities and society as a whole; not just about religious minorities as fringe movements but about their place in the mainstream.

I’m a monster. I just really like bread. And baking. And food. My personal mantra: Nutella is love. Nutella is life.Can you relate?I guessed so. Unless you’re allergic to nuts. :-( If there is a God, why would he make people get an anaphylactic shock just from having a spoonful of Nutella? It’s just cruel you know? It’s like God wanted us to invent nutella, and then he jumps in at the last minute to tell us people are gonna be allergic.

According to Simone, Charles Manson‘s very young fiancée only got engaged to the convicted murderer so that she could put his body on “public display” after he died. At the time, 80-year-old Manson figured out he’d been deceived and never got married. Read the very interesting story here. [NYPost]

A total 96% of Japanese high schoolers reportedly have a mobile phone, against 60% of junior high school students High school girls in Japan spend an average of seven hours a day on their mobile phones, a new survey has found, with nearly 10 percent of them putting in at least 15 hours. Boys of the same age average just over four hours mobile phone use a day, the survey by information security firm Digital Arts, published Monday, said. Teenagers tend to use their phones for social media, such as Line, a Japanese messaging and networking app, as well as smartphone games, making movies and other sharing apps like Instagram. The poll comes amid growing concern over youngsters getting addicted to their portable technology, with Chinese research showing heavy phone use provokes the same kind of neurological changes as alcohol or cocaine dependency. A total 96 percent of Japanese high schoolers have a mobile phone, against 60 percent of junior high school students, Digital Arts said. Almost four in every ten children in the upper years of elementary school -- from the age of 10 -- use a mobile. The survey, which was carried out online, quizzed 618 children from schools across Japan.

One detail that has us scratching our head a little is the phone’s SoC. It’s not explicitly named here, but Sony’s spec pages identify the GPU as an Adreno 330 – which last time we checked, was only in Snapdragon 800-series models. We had previously heard that the E4 could run a MediaTek MT6582, and while that would make sense with the 1.3GHz clock speed given here, that SoC uses a different GPU. We’re reaching out to Sony for clarification. Update: No word from Sony just yet, but a white paper for the E4 identifies the SoC as a MediTek MT6582 with Mali-400 MP2 GPU – we’re assuming mention of the Adreno 330 was in error. Update 2: Sony’s confirmed with us that the Adreno stuff (as well as a stray mention of Lollipop) was a mistake – the E4 runs a MediaTek SoC and ships with KitKat.

In order to release weight, you must intake less calories than the calories you burn in a day. So yes, you will have to modify your food and/or increase your exercise. Some of you may not be ready for exercise yet and that's okay, you can build up to it. Exercise is an excellent source of burning calories, not to mention numerous other benefits. You will want to choose a combination of cardio as well as weights. Choose something you enjoy - bike riding, running, walking, surfing, basketball, skipping, skiing - for your cardio and mix it up as often as you can. Your body adapts to what you are doing and by changing it up regularly, it will have to keep working different muscles. Weights are really important to keep your muscle mass which keeps your metabolism elevated. Please don't think you're going to bulk up if you do weights - that's another program altogether! When designing your weight loss journey it is important to choose whole foods as opposed to refined or processed foods. The easiest way to remember this is to shop on the outskirts of the supermarket - fresh is best. The frequency of your meals and snacks is also important to keep your metabolism working. Ideally 3 meals and 2 snacks per day ensures you are feeding your body regularly. I'm loving the changes in my body and health and hope you decide that now is the time to make a difference.

I am a children's book author and a freelance writer. My new children's book was just published in May by Headline Kids (a division of Headline Books, Inc.) and is meant to empower children, parents and teachers to keep children safe from abduction or predator harm. The book was recently honored with the Best Books Award Finalist USA Book News. My newest book, The Bully and the Booger Baby: A Cautionary Tale, was published in June, 2013.

As a current board member of the Historic Pullman Foundation, it is surprising to see the news today.

Having said all that, perhaps Welles’s fate as a director is analogous with that of Joseph Heller as a novelist. When critics complained that Heller had never again written a novel as good as Catch-22 (the film adaptation of which Welles starred in as the preposterously named, and generally preposterous, Brigadier General Dreedle), Heller would always say, “Who has?” Similarly, if Welles never again made a film as good as Kane...well, who has? And that’s not to say he didn’t produce other treasures.

The Special Assistant to President Goodluck Jonathan on New Media, Reno Omokri, has faulted claim by the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Major Gen Muhammadu Buhari, that Nigeria has been reduced to a failed state. Omokri argued that there are challenges confronting the country but Nigeria is not a failed state, stressing that it is unfortunate that a former Head of state and a presidential hopeful will speak ill of his country. “With due respect sir, Nigeria is not a ‘failed state’. Yes, we do have some challenges but true leaders do not condemn their nation to the world, “he said. Omokri reminded Gen. Buhari that Nigeria is making giant strides that place it among the respected countries in the world. “Do failed states defeat Ebola, be the world’s 3rd fastest growing economy, be investors’ destination and the largest economy in Africa?” Omokri queried. Recalled that Buhari in an interview on Al Jazeera, Sunday, said that the “government has failed in its principal duty of protecting life or property of all beings inside its territory”. Although there is no general consensus on the definition, a failed state is a state perceived as having failed at some of the basic conditions and responsibilities of a sovereign government. Some of the characteristics of failed state are loss of control of its territory, or of the monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force therein, erosion of legitimate authority to make collective decisions, inability to provide public services and inability to interact with other states as a full member of the international community

And the government’s response? At a business leaders’ meeting recently David Cameron pathetically asked bosses if they would give their staff a pay-rise, and so spread their ever-increasing wealth around*. I thought in a Free Market Economic system wealth was supposed to naturally ‘trickle down’ anyway? Clearly not, and if Cameron thinks his desperate pleas will make any difference to their behaviour, he clearly has little understanding of the business community he claims to represent.

Judge Hellerstein today issued an order giving the government until March 17th to explain to him “the factual basis” for deciding whether the photos can be released, or else lose its case. “At minimum,” he wrote, the government “must describe the categories of objectionable content contained in the photographs, identify how many photographs fit into each category, and specify the type of harm that would result from disclosing such content.” That rationale may be filed under seal, he said.

One of the most expensive paintings, Femme aux Bras Crois�s, was auctioned in the year 2000. Just after its creation the painting was bought by Gertrude Stein from Picasso. Later on, the painting was taken over by McCormick family who organized an auction at Christie's Rockefeller in New York City and sold Femme aux Bras Crois�s for $55,000,000 on November 8, 2000. The price of the painting made it as one of the most expensive paintings ever sold in an auction by then.

a dominating colour on canvas with little emphasis on any other, Picasso is able to create many emotions simply by the tone of his image. This coupled with the exression of the woman and her body language, all connote a sense of mystery and intrigue.

Libertarianism rests on the whimsical notion that all people are isolated, entirely free agents with no claims on others except those that they can negotiate through consensual contracts. The very existence of children flatly disproves this; any moral intuition indicates that children come into the world with claims on their parents at the very least, and their entire societies considered broadly. To avoid a hellish death spiral of infectious disease and neglect, we would all do well to reject Paul and his cohort on the subject of child rearing.

port of this duty inadequate, we can only conclude that no such duty exists … one has to regard the notion of a legal duty of parents to support their children as without merit.” Evers allows that parents might be morally obligated to do something for their children, but also that morals should not be legally enforced. Therefore, vaccination, labor, and finally whether or not to give one’s children the necessities of life ultimately comes down, for these classic libertarian thinkers, to the free will of the parents.

Said Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC, legal counsel for Bobby Brown. "However the false reports that continue to appear in print and on the internet are egregious, false and will be dealt with at an appropriate time. In particular, the false reporting of TMZ, The National Enquirer, The Atlanta Journal Constitution and the Daily Mail (UK) citing, police sources, family sources and Bobby Brown himself, will receive my attention. The desire to be "first" has clouded the judgment of many reporters as they forgo accuracy. This is a criminal investigation and the integrity of that process requires silence." Brown added.

"In the past, studies trying to understand the signs associated with impending death were conducted in people who were recognized as dying," Hui noted. "With our study, we observed a list of signs in patients from the time they were admitted to the palliative care unit. They were observed systematically, twice a day, without knowing if the patient would die or be discharged." This lack of bias from the start, Hui explained, suggests the current study is more credible.

This app does not allow you to display photos in “portrait” view. It only shows the photos in “landscape” view. This means if you want to use your iPad as a photo frame and dock it, it will display all your photos rotated 90 degrees. Sure, the app lets you individually edit every photo and rotate it relative to the landscape view, but this is hardly convenient when you want to quickly throw 100+ photos up on your iPad as a photo frame. This app is loaded with all sorts of useless features, but lacks basic functionality for “slideshows,” even though “slideshow” is in the app’s name! For this I paid $4. I haven’t hated an app this much in a long time. Avoid!!!

The platform of the nationalists and anti-reform parties of left and right offer what they always offer: anger but not answers. They peddle ghastly and reactionary myths about immigrants; they pretend that complex problems have easy pain-free solutions; and there is a worrying authoritarianism (evident in their admiration for the Vladimir Putin brand of leadership) which lurks only a little beneath the surface. But if the centre does not lead, the extremes will be followed. The Greek crisis is an opportunity. It has to be seized.

A relatively trouble child who stole everything in sight, he grows up to become one of the greatest track stars of his time, shattering the national high school record in the mile and becoming one of the youngest members of the U.S. Olympic team in 1936. Many felt that Zamperini would become the first person to break the four minute mile. With the onset of the war, he was drafted into the Army Air Force and became a bombardier assigned to the semi-unreliable B-24. After surviving a number of bombing missions against Japanese targets his plane goes down in the middle of the ocean while searching for another downed plane.Read more ›

As we go about our day today, let us try to remember what it means to be kind – and, what it means to be unkind. Let us remember that the little things we do (like rolling our eyes or laughing at gossip) can be perceived as very hurtful, while other little kindnesses (like welcoming a new friend or smiling at someone in the hall) are a reflection of you. Let us trade out unkind actions for kind actions. Let us be aware that what this fictional principal said to his students is something we should carry with us – that “it’s not enough to be kind”; that we “should be kinder than needed,” “kinder than is necessary.” And, let us remember that by offering kindness to our neighbor, we in turn follow the commandment to love one another, we demonstrate how you loved us, and we demonstrate that we are your disciples.

Solving mysteries, both criminal and medical, requires good data – including data that is often overlooked or has not previously been available. It’s fun to imagine what a modern Sherlock Holmes could do with the data provided by wearable devices. Fortunately, we don’t have to do too much imagining when it comes to the many formerly missing pieces of health information that are now available to physicians to assist in a more holistic patient assessment. The more information doctors have, the better able they are to reasonably deduce the best plan for individual patient health.

Go get a job and what? Pay bills. Right. If you haven't noticed most 26 year old + are on the path to having ZERO drive, or care for a stable career. Corrupt? More like way it is.

There is a lot of truth in this.

The artwork, narration and soundtrack are gorgeous and professionally done. The icing on the cake is that the artwork is done on muted tones of parchment paper and gives the book a sense of ancient import and a story to be listened to or read. You can almost feel the history of the story as your fingers dance along the page. I really appreciate how the interactions are purposeful to the story and going from page to page is not always a linear process.

I did not really enjoy the AKERHON's side of the split that much, if at all. To me it really brought this album down a couple points.

At a business leaders’ meeting recently David Cameron pathetically asked bosses if they would give their staff a pay-rise, and so spread their ever-increasing wealth around*. I thought in a Free Market Economic system wealth was supposed to naturally ‘trickle down’ anyway? Clearly not, and if Cameron thinks his desperate pleas will make any difference to their behaviour, he clearly has little understanding of the business community he claims to represent.

This book delivers. If you are a writer, you'll find a wealth of information and insight thatwill allow you to assess your style and discover practical ways to make good writing better.Even popular published authors can benefit from this book. For instance, I am a Stephenie Meyer fan. She isa master of her genre, but if she had read Sammie Justesen's book, Edward would not have"snickered" and "chuckled" so much that these particular dialogue tags became annoying and distracting.Sammie Justesen's book offers great advice from a number of perspectives including the all-important publisher's perspective. I have no hesitation in rating it a five-star book.

 good editing, try this book. If your writing could benefit from some new tricks, try this book. It won't disappoint. I think of it as a course on dialogue in itself and there are exercises at the end of each chapter.

ng fluff photo. It would take several minutes if not an hour to make the watch look like the photo. The design is unlike any other wrap bracelet style I've ever seen; that is not intended to be a compliment. Second, the materials are of the cheapest possibly quality. I didn't realize that because the reviews didn't really spell that out; they were mostly positive. Third, the watch DOES come with a battery - there is a small white gizmo propping up the adjustment knob. It is too small to see in my photos. Yay for the battery....but, you know, good old fashioned instructions explaining this would have been nice. As you can see, other reviewers said the watch didn't work or didn't come with a battery, so I'm not the only one who would appreciate a heads up. Fourth, it took a whole 32 days from the day I ordered it to receive this globetrotting jewelry. Fifth, the price has dropped $3 since I placed my order 32 days ago. Someone must have decided to be more honest in product pricing. The only positive I can name is that there are 3 size points so it can be worn loose or tight as one desires. I love my other wrap bracelet (purchased elsewhere) but this one I can't stand.

Jo, I am deeply moved beyond words today as I read your writing and saw the pictures. I remember the day we shared in the gazebo…when I saw your face change and the tears flow…I cried with you as I remember the flood gates flowing from my eyes in the dark experience of my own life. God has walked with you all the way and touched your heart, soul and mind when he knew you were ready …our God is gentle and feels our pain. Your sharing these intimate details will bring healing to many but most of all to you. Bless you. Gay Lynne

As per our research and analysis, it is quite clear that bitcoin related startups are contributing well to today’s job market. Although bitcoin related businesses didn’t create more jobs than the US Federal government did in 2014, the magnitude of job opportunities created by bitcoin startups is significant enough to reduce unemployment rates, not only in the USA, but also in other parts of the world. Despite the fact that bitcoin price has been declining throughout most of 2014, the real bitcoin value hasn’t been dropping as shown by the steady rise in various bitcoin related businesses and projects.

Obesity has become a life threatening health issue today. Adults are not the only ones battling the problem. Children and teenagers have also become largely overweight due to faulty eating and lifestyle habits. Correcting diet habits and exercising regularly are sure-fire methods to lose weight. However, how long it might take to drop a significant amount of weight using these two measures depends upon your body’s constitution.

As we had still the Camper van, which was fully furnished and equipped, we had to think about how we convert it into a camping vehicle. There was the idea to strip it completely and build a box from 2×2.5 meters with a heights of 2 meters. We did not do that, because we simply could not afford it. So we took out the furniture from our camper van and adjusted it to fit into the Land Rover. So we have got storage for food and cloth, a bench to sit with table and an emergency bed, which is rather small but it is just for emergency. We bought two tents, a small one for one night stays, which is quickly pitched and a larger one, if we stay longer at a place which provides more comfort. So we had a space problem which we solved as follows: The sand ladders were fitted outside at the rear side windows, which are also a kind of protection against theft, and we had bought the Land Rover with a roof rack, where we build a simple box on it (thanks Rick from Kamanjab, Namibia, who helped us a lot and gave us an awning for the side). Aside the box we fitted the spare jerry cans. All the conversion was done in Oppi Koppi rest camp, Namibia, where Vital and Marianne provided the tools and space where we could work on the Land Rover. Thanks to them as well. Now the basic vehicle was finished, but it was lacking some decoration, so Andrea from Gelbingen Guest Farm painted animal footprints and black people on the Land Rover, which later turned out was a great help, because all police men were laughing about the vehicle and checks were done quite easy. Thanks Andrea! The basic conversion was finished and we could start.

In colder temperatures: If you're smart, you'll take your workout indoors. While you can technically still run outside when it's clear, the air can be extremely dry in the winter, so you have to cover your nose and mouth. And because it's so freaking cold, you should also wear leg warmers or calf tights, slip on an even heavier jacket, and wear trail-running shoes with extra grip to avoid slips. In other words, it's a real schlep to sweat in tundra-like conditions. Spare yourself and stay warm with a cardio workout you can do indoors.

Country music fans could not be happier because this is looking to be a big year for country music. Tim McGraw, one of today’s biggest country music stars, will appear at most of the 2015 Country Megaticket concert shows, but he’s announced his summer plans (aka Shotgun Rider Tour) to tour with Billy Currington and Chase Bryant. Beginning in June, Tim McGraw will be hitting the road on his own tour and brining along two other country favorites Billy Currington and Chase Bryant. The trio will be visiting states such as Massachusetts, Arizona, New Mexico, North Carolina, Connecticut, New Jersey, Virginia, Kansas, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Utah, California, plus others along with a handful of shows up in Canada too. Tim McGraw puts on one heck of a concert so we suggest fans get a hold of tickets as soon as they can. Since his tour dates are quite numerous, you should easily be able to see him at a venue near you. Look below for the latest list of Tim McGraw tour dates, links to get Tim McGraw concert tickets and some popular Tim McGraw music videos and photos.

Now what to do? While discussing our situation, we heard a truck in the far distance. Luckily it was driving our way and Demelash stopped it to explain our situation. The men were willing to help for 1000 bir. Alexandra got really angry and was scolding them. Her argument was that we helped other Ethiopian people a lot and now when we need help they demand extraordinary amounts of money. BUT this is Africa as well. I offered 300 birr and finally for 500 birr they towed us the 100 meter that were necessary to continue back. Demelash meant that was the worst spot, we would manage it now back until Jinka. These situations happen frequently on an African trip, where you have to bargain hard, although you are in troubles. It was still 30 km back to our campsite, I considered changing the tires but decided against it, so we continued on the carcass, had to cross a river and in Jinka we tried to get tires but they were not available in our size. So we had to change tires and continue without spare wheels, which might be rather risky in this area. Back at the hotel I changed both front tires, so we had only these two ruined tires as spares. I thought that at least for emergency they would make the job and we would try to get tires in Turmi next day. Lesson: Never go without two spare wheels, we were glad we had.

In an insurrectionary world, the question of how the Internet might be restructured —and with what ramifications for business— was not only increasingly palpable but also vital.

To safeguard better the strategic long-term interests of The West in the war against Islamic terrorism, US politicians should keep a copy of “The Prince”, written by Niccolo Machiavelli, on their night tables. He had the following advice to those working in the spying profession:”If you need to injure someone, do it in such a way that you do not have to fear their vengeance.” Meaning, next time you interrogate an Islamic terrorist, while you are waging a war, don’t send him to Guantanamo. Finish the work by expediting his transition (with extreme prejudice) from this earthly journey to Allah’s heavenly kingdom, and let the jihadi discover if he is getting 72 virgins or a 72-year-old virgin. It is the only method that will minimize acts of vengeance and improve your chances of survival in the war.

No one got under Barack’s skin more than [New York Times columnist] Maureen [Dowd] ... Her penchant for delving into the psyches of her subjects was particularly irritating to the self-possessed Obama. ... Normally polite under any circumstances, he was patronizing and disrespectful to Maureen in a way I had rarely seen. This was not well received by Dowd who, like most journalists, was accustomed to firing off salvos, yet decidedly uncomfortable when fired upon herself. After that awkward encounter, she seemed to take particular delight in psychoanalyzing Barack and belittling him in print, which only deepened his contempt. Maureen, who is as gracious and loyal to her friends as she is rough on the high and mighty, would become a friend of mine in Washington, which became a minor source of tension with Obama. ‘Why are you friends with her?’ he would demand after Maureen sent one of her acid darts his way.
